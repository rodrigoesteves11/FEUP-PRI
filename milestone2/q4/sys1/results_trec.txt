This species is found from Portugal to Azerbaijan and from Sweden to Canary Islands, where a sub-species was identified. It has a short nose, small eyes and wide ears. The conservation status of B. barbastellus is assessed as "near threatened", "vulnerable", "critically endangered" or "extinct" in various parts of its range.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'conservation_status': 'Near Threatened', 'sections': 'The western barbastelle was described as a new species in 1774 by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber, who placed it in the genus Vespertilio, with a species name of Vespertilio barbastellus. The holotype had been collected in Burgundy, France. In 1836 it was placed in the genus Barbastellus, and the first use of its current name combination of Barbastella barbastellus was in 1897 by Gerrit Smith Miller Jr. The  name Barbastella barbastellus might be coming from  the  Latin barba (beard) and stella (star). Viewed  from the side, it seems that the upper lip has a beard, or a moustache.\n\nTwo subspecies are recognized by Mammal Species of the World (2005):\n\nIn addition to morphological measurement, DNA analysis confirmed the presence of an endemic sub-species in the Canary Islands as well as a relatively homogeneous genetic structure among populations of the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, and probably, across Europe as far as the Thrace region.\n\nThe barbastelle is a medium-sized bat, with a characteristic pug-shaped nose. The ears are broad, joined across its head by skin, and covered in gingery-brown fur on the rear surface. The tragus is triangular – broad at the base but with a nearly parallel tip which starts about halfway along its length. Head and body length is between 40 and 55\xa0mm and wingspan is between 26 and 29\xa0cm (10 and 11\xa0in). Forearm length is 3.5 to 4.5\xa0cm (1.4 to 1.8\xa0in) and body mass is 6 to 13\xa0g (0.21 to 0.46\xa0oz).\n\nBarbastelles roost in splits or behind loose bark of trees all year, generally in mature deciduous forests, as well as rock crevices and  within human buildings. In central Italy, tall dead beech in unmanaged woodland were found to be preferred as roost trees. While barbastelles typically remain within a single roosting area, they move between individual roosts with great frequency.\n\nBarbastelles migrate to underground roosting sites over the winter, although they may stay within arboreal roosts in the beginning of the season. Winter roosting sites include natural caves and human structures such as basements, mines and bunkers. Barbastelles are relatively resistant to cold conditions, and are typically found hibernating in cold sites and in exposed positions.\n\nBarbastelles feed chiefly on moths, as well as on flies. Research from Switzerland showed that the biologically most productive parts of the forest are exploited in priority by this species while hunting  and that ca. 99% of prey by volume consisted of Lepidoptera. More recent studies confirmed this predominance of Lepidoptera, underlining that medium-sized and larger specimens are targeted in priority by the barbastelles. However, seasonal diet changes were recorded during autumn due to potential interspecific competition with Plecotus austriacus and strong decrease of flying larger moths.\n\nThe diet of the barbastelles appears to be one of the narrowest among European bats. This specialization in foraging habits probably points to a higher vulnerability of this species to negative changes in the abundance of moth populations. This could explain its current rarity throughout most of its range.\n\nWhile foraging, barbastelles behave as typical aerial-hawking bat species despite the fact that they hunt exclusively just above the forest canopy. This peculiar foraging technique could be explained by the co-evolution with the defence system of its prey.\n\nSpecimens can travel up to 20\xa0km per night for foraging purposes and nonreproductive females forage at greater distances than reproductive females \n\nIndividuals reach their sexual maturity after one or two years. After total sexual segregation during most of spring and summer, the mating period starts at the end of summer, sometimes during swarming episodes. The mating period is often finishing with the start of the hibernation, but some cases of late mating during winter and early spring have been observed \nAround May–June, each pregnant female gives birth to one or two newborn juveniles which she breastfeeds up to 6 weeks.\n\nThe barbastelle has two main call types used for echolocation. The frequency parameters of call type 1 lie between 30 and 38\xa0kHz, have most energy at 33\xa0kHz and have an average duration of 2.5\xa0ms. The frequency parameters of call type 2 lie between 29 and 47\xa0kHz, have most energy at 38\xa0kHz and have an average duration of 4.1\xa0ms.\n\nThis species is rare and most of the time decreasing throughout its range. Some historical data from the 19th century   refers to the presence of western barbastelles in Senegal. This data is considered as doubtful.\n\nThis species is protected in the European Union under the Habitats Directive, meaning that habitats and roosts use by this species may be considered for notification as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. This species is also listed in the Berne Convention and is specifically targeted by the UNEP-EUROBATS convention. Several national legislation are also protecting this species and its habitats in many countries and regions.\n\nIn order to highlight the importance of protecting this species at the European scale, this species was selected as bat species of the Year 2020-2021 by the pan-European NGO BatLife Europe.\n\nThis species is classified as near threatened (NT) in the worldwide IUCN Red List, while it is considered as vulnerable (VU) at the European and European Union scale  and near threatened (NT) in the Mediterranean Red List.', 'score': 14.353487}, {'id': 'Gomphus_graslinii', 'name': ['Gomphus graslinii'], 'introduction': '\n\nGomphus graslini Rambur, 1842 [orth. error]\n\nGomphus graslinii is a species of dragonfly in the family Gomphidae.

In Galicia and lowland Portugal, breeding takes place from November to March, but in upland areas, it occurs from March to May. Amplexus, with the male clinging to the back of the female, takes place in the water. Small clumps of eggs with a gelatinous coat are laid and are stuck to water weeds or placed beneath underwater stones. When the tadpoles hatch, they feed on vegetable matter and take about three months before they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs. These are about 1.3\xa0cm (0.5\xa0in) long. Males become mature when they are about 3\xa0cm (1.2\xa0in) in length and females when they are rather larger.\n\nThe Iberian frog is threatened by habitat loss through agriculture, deforestation, and the planting of non-native woodlands.

The devil fish is the third largest species in the genus Mobula, after the oceanic and reef manta rays. It is the only mobulid species that lives in the Mediterranean Sea. The species has been observed to have a maximum recorded length of disk width of 5.2 meters (roughly 17 feet). However, those data are unreliable and are allegedly misunderstood as Giant oceanic Manta Rays that have strayed into the Mediterranean. It is also considered to be the only Devil fish with a tail spine.\n\nThe Devil fish is most common in the Mediterranean Sea. It is also found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, off the southwest coast of Ireland and south of Portugal, as well as in the central and western Pacific Ocean. In the Mediterranean Sea, the species has a basin-wide distribution and is most frequent in the eastern Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea. The large aggregations observed in the Levantine basin could signal an important mating area.\n\nDevil fish inhabit offshore areas to the neritic zone, their range as deep as several thousand meters. They are typically observed in small clusters, and may occasionally form larger groups.\n\nGiant devil rays are usually seen in deep coastal waters but are occasionally seen in shallow waters. In a tagging experiment conducted by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), three giant devil rays were tagged and their depth was observed throughout different times of the day. The rays reached a maximum depth of 600–700 meters (2,000–2,300\xa0ft) but mostly spent their time between 0 and 50 meters (0 and 164\xa0ft); they prefer warmer waters with a temperature between 20 and 29\xa0°C (68 and 84\xa0°F). The giant devil rays also deep dive at random times, instances not correlated to the time of day unlike how other species deep dive at specific times of day. In other observations studying ray abundance and habitat, giant devil rays were observed alone and occasionally in groups with a maximum of 18 rays. The same study also emphasizes that the rays undergo a species migration across the Mediterranean Sea with the seasons, taking advantage of warm, highly productive waters.\n\nThe average lifespan of a giant devil ray is 20 years. It is an epipelagic species. It has a very low reproductive capacity. This means that the species gives birth to a single offspring at unknown intervals. The species is ovoviviparous: the young hatch from their eggs inside the mother\'s body and emerge later when they are more fully grown. The disc width of the pups born at the Osaka Aquarium was 1.03\xa0m (3\xa0ft 5\xa0in).\n\nIt can be predicted that at the rate that its population is declining now, the population will decline by at least 50% in the next 60 years. This is due to a number of threats including the poor likelihood of recovering from declining populations.\n\nDevil rays feed on planktonic crustaceans and small schooling fish, which are funneled into the mouth with cephalic flaps. When these flaps are rolled up, they look like horns, giving the animal a "devil-like" silhouette. It mostly eats euphausiid shrimp (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and small mesopelagic and clupeid fishes.\n\nThe devil fish has a limited range and a low rate of reproduction. As a result, it is sensitive to environmental changes. Its population trend is decreasing. Most of the information on the giant devil ray has been gathered through bycatch data because the species has a high bycatch mortality. Giant devil ray mortalities are mostly reported as bycatch from swordfish nets, and occasionally reported as bycatch from longlines, purse seines, trawls, trammel nets, and tuna traps. There are many threats against the giant devil ray such as fishing, resource harvesting (being taken as bycatch in different fisheries), industrial garbage, and solid waste. The main threats to this species come from pollution in the Mediterranean and bycatch capture in various fishing equipment including trawls, tuna traps, and dragnets meant for swordfish. All species of the genus Mobula have been targeted by recreational and commercial fisheries for centuries. Fisheries in Gaza and Egypt are reported to catch giant devil rays for local consumption, and they are reported as bycatch in various places including the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe 2004 IUCN Red List listed the devil fish as a vulnerable species. It was reclassified as endangered in 2006 due to low population resilience coupled with continued high bycatch mortality. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the devil fish as "Data Deficient" with the qualifier "Secure Overseas" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

It is the typical species of the Iberian dehesa or montado, where its sweet-astringent acorns are a source of food for livestock, particularly the Iberian pig. Its acorns have also been used for human nourishment since the Neolithic era (7,000 BC). It is placed in section Ilex. Some authors described it as a subspecies of Quercus ilex.', 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'conservation_status': 'Least Concern', 'sections': "Quercus rotundifolia is a medium to large tree, usually 8–12\xa0m (26–39\xa0ft) in height, but can reach up to 15\xa0m (49\xa0ft) with a large, dense, rounded canopy. It has small, leathery, dark-green leaves with a glaucous, densely pubescent underside usually suborbicular to elliptical or lanceolate and are generally spiny to dentate on a younger tree. It has a semi-hemispheric cupule.\n\nIt flowers from February to April. Seedlings will start flowering at about eight years old, but they will not start producing acorns until 15 to 20 years old, although trees in humid, good quality soils can start production as early as 10 years. The acorns ripen in autumn, about six months after pollination.\n\nIt is a resilient tree that can survive temperatures below −20\xa0°C (−4\xa0°F), and that on occasion reach 47\xa0°C (117\xa0°F).\n\nAs opposed to Quercus ilex, its acorns have a very low level of bitterness tannins and so are generally sweet and a good energy source for livestock.\n\nQuercus rotundifolia is native to most of the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain), but is also distributed throughout Morocco, especially in the Atlas Mountains, Algeria, Tunisia, southern France (Languedoc-Roussillon) and the Balearic Islands. It is present in continental, sub-continental or littoral Mediterranean areas but always in climatic conditions determined by a fairly hot and dry summer, which excludes the wet, oceanic influenced climate of Green Spain and northwest Portugal, but requires wet winters as the tree is absent from arid climates and those with no real wet months like southeast Spain. It grows in a variety of soils and is indifferent to variations in edaphic conditions, persisting in soils with pH from six to eight. The tree is also associated in holm oak/Atlas cedar forests of the Atlas Mountains. In Morocco, some of these mixed forests are habitat to the endangered Barbary macaque.\n\nThe tree inhabits dense oak forests, open oak forests and sub-savanna ecosystems, from sea level up to 1,900\xa0m (6,200\xa0ft) a.s.l. It can live in all altitudes in Portugal, switching with Quercus suber. The grasses and herbs beneath it support low-density mixed animal grazing during wetter season(s) and, when the grasses die down in summer, the acorns from the oak trees (at densities of 30 to 50 trees per hectare), plus oak foliage and some retained crops support the animals until the grasses return. It can tolerate frost and short periods of light snow.\n\nThe species is threatened by the destruction of its habitat for agriculture, vineyards and pine or eucalyptus plantations. Like other perennial oaks in the Iberian Peninsula, Quercus rotundifolia is also affected by Phytophthora cinnamomi which is becoming more dangerous due to the increased frequency and duration of droughts associated with climate change and, especially in Portugal, a decline for the taxa has been reported. The tree is also affected by wildfires, though it regenerates well from resprouts. The leaves are eaten by case moth caterpillars, but the tree is not particularly threatened by them. In New Zealand, the caterpillar of the puriri moth has also been observed to feed on the tree's bark. The tree is notably resistant to honey fungus.\n\nThe holm oak, along with the cork oak, is a protected tree by law in Portugal.\n\nThe holm oak's wood is traditionally used to make charcoal. The acorns can be consumed both by animals and humans. The bark is rich in tannin components for traditional medicinal uses. Quercus rotundifolia is also used as a host plant for the production of both the black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) and the summer truffle (Tuber aestivum var aestivum).\n\nThe tree's acorns have been used by humans since the Neolithic era.

Colonies tend to be compact, centred on favoured breeding areas. Heath fritillaries are highly sedentary for the most part, adults rarely moving more than 100\xa0m; however, some have been recorded dispersing up to 2\xa0km.

They are ribbed (longitudinally, i.e. from top to bottom) and striated (transversely, i.e. around the egg). Pale cream when laid, eggs darken to pale yellow within two days, and then dark grey a few days before hatching. Eggs mature in two to three weeks.\n\nUpon emergence, first-instar caterpillars (or larvae) eat their eggshells. The caterpillars from a clutch initially stay together, feeding in a small, unobtrusive web. Second or third instar caterpillars disperse into smaller groups. Then the third instars tend to feed and rest solitarily; they rest beneath dead leaves at night and during bad weather. The caterpillar hibernates for the winter in a hibernaculum, made from a curled dead leaf by spinning its edges together. Hibernacula are usually close to the ground. Although most caterpillars hibernate singly, they sometimes group in twos and threes, although 15 to 20 caterpillars have been found in single hibernaculum.\n\nCaterpillars re-emerge in early spring. When it is warm, they feed a little, but most of the time is spent basking in the sun. There are six instars in total. The full-grown sixth instar caterpillar is 22–25\xa0mm long, and predominantly black; it has pale (yellow-orange) spines and (greyish-white) spots.\n\nThe pupae are 12.4–12.8\xa0cm long and last 15–25 days (early May to late June in the UK). They are white with black and orange-brown blotches.

Year assessed: 2005.\n\nIt is, however, listed as a protected species (Appendix III) under the Berne Convention.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'conservation_status': 'Least Concern', 'score': 9.749716}, {'id': 'Triturus_pygmaeus', 'name': ['Triturus pygmaeus'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe southern marbled newt or pygmy marbled newt (Triturus pygmaeus) is a species of salamander in the family Salamandridae.

Cerris. It is the primary source of cork for wine bottle stoppers and other uses, such as cork flooring and as the cores of cricket balls.  It is native to southwest Europe and northwest Africa. In the Mediterranean basin the tree is an ancient species with fossil remnants dating back to the Tertiary period. It can survive for as long as two centuries. Typically, once it reaches 25 years old, its thick bark can be harvested for cork every 9 to 12 years without causing harm to the tree.\n\nIt endures drought and makes little demand on the soil quality and is regarded as a defence against desertification. Cork oak woodlands are home to a multitude of animal and plant species. Since cork is increasingly being displaced by other materials as a bottle cap, these forests are at risk as part of the cultural landscape and as a result animal species such as the Iberian lynx and imperial eagles are threatened with extinction.', 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'conservation_status': 'Least Concern', 'sections': 'The cork oak grows as an evergreen tree, reaching an average height of 10 to 15 metres (33 to 49 feet) or in rare cases up to 25\xa0m and a trunk diameter (DBH) of 50 to 100 centimetres (20 to 39 inches). It forms a dense and asymmetrical crown that starts at a height of 2–3\xa0m (6+1⁄2–10\xa0ft) and spreads widely in free-standing trees. The crown can be divided into several separate, rounded partial crowns.\n\nThe young twigs are densely hairy light gray or whitish. Older branches are strong and knotty. Older trees only form short shoots between 7 and 15\xa0cm (3 and 6\xa0in) in length.\n\nThe thick, longitudinally cracked cork layers of the gray-brown trunk bark are characteristic of the cork oak. The cambium of the smooth bark of young trees forms a cork layer very early on, which can be 3 to 5\xa0cm (1+1⁄4 to 2\xa0in) thick. The light and spongy cork fabric shows vertical cracks and is white on the outside and red to red-brown on the inside. After the cork has been harvested, the trunk appears reddish brown, but later it is significantly darker. The wood is ring-pored, has a brown heartwood and a light reddish sapwood. The cork oak develops a taproot that reaches a depth of 1 to 2\xa0m (3+1⁄4 to 6+1⁄2\xa0ft) and from which several meters long, horizontally running side roots extend. The trees can live over 400 years, and harvested specimens can be 150 to 200 years old.\n\nThe leathery leaves are alternate and are 2.5 to 10\xa0cm (1 to 4\xa0in) long and 1.2 to 6.5\xa0cm (1⁄2 to 2+1⁄2\xa0in) wide. The shape varies between round, oval and lanceolate-oval. The leaf blade has five to seven sharp teeth on both edges and a pointed vegetation cone (apex). The midrib stands out clearly on the underside of the leaf, the first-order lateral nerves usually lead to the teeth of the leaf margin. The upper side of the leaf is light green, the underside of the leaf whitish and densely hairy. There is no hair on young trees. The leaf stalks are 6 to 18 millimetres (1⁄4 to 3⁄4\xa0in) long and are also hairy. At the base of the petiole are two narrow, lanceolate, 5\xa0mm (1⁄4\xa0in) long and bright red stipules that fall off in the first year. The new leaves appear in April and May, when older leaves are also shed. They usually stay on the tree for two to three years, less often only one year, the latter especially in severe environmental conditions and on the northern border of the distribution area. Extremely cold winters can also lead to complete defoliation.\n\nThe cork oak is single sexed (monoecious), with both female and male flowers on one specimen. The female flowers form upright inflorescences in the leaf axils of young branches. These are formed from a hairy axis 5 to 30\xa0mm (1⁄4 to 1+1⁄4\xa0in) long with two to five separate flowers. The female flowers contain a small, hairy, four- to six-lobed flower envelope and three to four styles. The male catkins also arise on the leaf axils of young branches. They are bright red at the beginning and stand upright, older catkins are yellow and pendulous, 4 to 7\xa0cm (1+1⁄2 to 2+3⁄4\xa0in) long and have a whitish hairy axis. The single flowers are sessile and have a densely hairy flower cover that is colored red when opened. The four to six stamens are whitish with yellow, egg-shaped anthers. They are longer than the bracts.\n\nThe fruit clusters are 0.5 to 4\xa0cm (1⁄4 to 1+1⁄2\xa0in) long and carry two to eight acorns. About half of the fruits are enclosed in the fruit cup (cupule); the fruit cups are 2 to 2.5\xa0cm (3⁄4 to 1\xa0in) in diameter. The upper scales of the cupula are gray and hairy, in the subspecies Quercus suber occidentalis the scales are close together or are fused. The size of the acorns varies between lengths of 2 to 4.5\xa0cm (3⁄4 to 1+3⁄4\xa0in) and diameters of 1 to 1.8\xa0cm (1⁄2 to 3⁄4\xa0in). The fruit casing (pericarp) is bare, smooth and shiny brownish red. The hilum (the starting point of the seed) is convex and has a diameter of 6 to 8\xa0mm (1⁄4 to 3⁄8\xa0in).\n\nQuercus suber is a species of the section Cerris to which, for example, the following species also belong:\n\nCharacteristic for the section are the hairless pericarp and the usually two-year ripening time of the fruits. The cork oak is an exception because the fruits can ripen in both the first and the second year.\n\nIn the species Quercus suber two subspecies are distinguished:\n\nTogether with the Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) and the holm oak (Quercus ilex), the cork oak forms hybrids.\n\nThe scientific name Quercus suber is derived from the Latin word quercus, which the Romans used to describe the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). The specific epithet suber means in Latin cork oak and also cork.\n\nThe cork oak occupies the area around the western Mediterranean basin. In Portugal, natural and cultivated stands cover an area of 750,000 hectares. There are natural populations of the nominate form at altitudes between 150 and 300\xa0m (490 and 980\xa0ft) above sea level, the subspecies occidentalis is found along the Atlantic coast. In Spain the occurrences remain mostly below 600\xa0m (2,000\xa0ft), but rarely reach heights of 1,200\xa0m (3,900\xa0ft). In Spain, cork oaks are common in the southern half of the country, as well as in the western and northeastern areas, but rare in central Spain. In Italy one finds natural occurrences along the Tyrrhenian Sea and in eastern Apulia on the Adriatic Sea. Also on the Adriatic is the cork oak on the Dalmatian coast. It is one of the most common forest trees in Sardinia. Natural and man-made occurrences exist in Africa on the Mediterranean coast of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco and at altitudes up to 1,000\xa0m (3,300\xa0ft), on the High Atlas up to 2,000\xa0m (6,600\xa0ft). In its native range, cork oak forests cover approximately 22,000 square kilometres (8,500 square miles). Outside of its natural range, the cork oak is cultivated in the Crimea, the Caucasus, India and the Southwestern United States. The subspecies Quercus suber occidentalis also thrives in mild areas of England.\n\nThe species needs very little light and cannot survive in dense populations.[clarification needed] It loves warmth, grows at annual mean temperatures of 13 to 17\xa0°C (55 to 63\xa0°F) and can withstand maximum temperatures of up to 40\xa0°C (104\xa0°F). In the area of distribution, the temperature rarely falls below freezing point, but temperatures down to −5\xa0°C (23\xa0°F) without damage and down to −10\xa0°C (14\xa0°F) without major damage can be tolerated. The cork oak is not hardy in Central Europe. It endures drought and survives dry periods in summer by reducing its metabolism. An annual rainfall of 500 to 700 millimetres (20 to 28\xa0in) is considered optimal, in cooler locations 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18\xa0in) can be sufficient with enough humidity. Cork oaks have low soil demands and also grow in poor, dry or rocky locations. They rarely thrive on calcareous soils, but they are often found on crystalline slates, on gneiss, granite and sands. The acidity of the soil should be between pH 4.5 and 7.\n\nThe cork oak is considered a pyrophyte because it recovers quickly after forest fires as it is protected by the cork.[citation needed]\n\nThe cork oak forest is one of the major plant communities of the Mediterranean woodlands and forests ecoregion. In natural populations, the cork oak grows together with the holm oaks (Quercus ilex, Quercus rotundifolia), the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), the Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica), Mirbeck\'s oak (Quercus canariensis), the maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), the stone pine (Pinus pinea), the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) and the olive tree (Olea europaea), in cooler locations also with the sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa). In addition to these tree species, the shrub-forming species include the Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera), the Lusitanian oak (Quercus lusitanica) the holly buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), species of the genus Phillyrea, the myrtle (Myrtus communis), the green heather (Erica scoparia), the common smilax (Smilax aspera) and the Montpellier cistus (Cistus monspeliensis) are often found together with the cork oak.\n\nAs a pyrophyte, this tree has a thick, insulating bark that makes it well adapted to forest fires. After a fire, many tree species regenerate from seeds (as, for example, the maritime pine) or re-sprout from the base of the tree (as, for example, the holm oak). The bark of the cork oak allows it to survive fires and then simply regrow branches to fill out the canopy. The quick regeneration of this oak makes it successful in the fire-adapted ecosystems of the Mediterranean biome.\n\nThe cork oak enters into a mycorrhizal symbiosis with several types of fungus. The fine root system of the oak is in close contact with the mycelium of the fungus. The oak receives water and nutrient salts from the fungus in exchange for products of photosynthesis. Such a symbiosis exists among others with the following species:\n\nCork oak is relatively resistant to pathogens, but some diseases occur in the species. Leaf spot can be caused by the fungus Apiognomonia errabunda. Other fungi can cause leaf scorching, powdery mildew, rust, and cankers.\n\nThe most virulent cork oak pathogen may be Diplodia corticola, a sac fungus which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus Biscogniauxia mediterranea is becoming more common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the oak pinhole borer (Platypus cylindrus), a species of weevil.\n\nThe common water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi grows in the roots of the tree and has been known to devastate cork oak woodlands.\n\nSeveral species of butterflies damage the cork oak, the most important being the spongy moth (Lymantria dispar). The species lays its eggs in the bark of the branches and trunks, and the caterpillars that hatch in spring are distributed in the crown and eat them bare. The bacterial species Bacillus thuringiensis is used as a biological plant protection agent against the spongy moth. Another pest is the green oak tortrix (Tortrix viridana), whose caterpillars eat flowers and young leaves and roll them up with thread to form typical coils. The lackey moth (Malacosoma neustria) also causes damage to the leaves, sticking its eggs to the bark of thin twigs in multiple rows, and also the brown-tail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea), whose caterpillars skeletonize the leaves and further damage the tree after overwintering in spring. A special cork pest is the jewel beetle Coraebus undatus, which lays its eggs in the cork tissue. Another harmful species of beetle is the great capricorn beetle (Cerambyx cerdo), whose larvae eat long corridors in the oak wood.\n\nUnfavorable climatic conditions and fungal attack are made responsible for the weakening of trees and for crown damage. Such fungal parasites of weakness are Botryosphaeria stevensii, Biscogniauxia mediterranea, Endothiella gyrosa and representatives of the mold genus Fusarium. Drought and parasite infestation are also considered to be the cause of the weakness syndrome in parts of Spain and Portugal.\n\nThe cork oak is grown for the production of cork in several Mediterranean countries. The centers of cork production are in southern Portugal (accounting for 50% of the total production) and southern Spain, where low trees with large crowns and strong branches are grown in large areas, which provide the highest yield of cork. These mostly extensively managed habitats are called montados in Portugal and dehesas in Spain. They are considered to be extremely valuable from the point of view of biodiversity and cultural heritage.\n\nThe cork consists of dead, air-filled, thin-walled cells and contains cellulose and suberin. Cork is heat and sound insulating, the suberine gives it water-repellent properties. The cork layer is replicated by the cork-producing phellogen and can therefore be harvested repeatedly without damaging the tree too much. The first harvest usually takes place after about 25 years with a trunk diameter (DBH) of 70\xa0cm (28\xa0in), though new techniques (such as better irrigation systems) could shorten it to only 8 to 10 years. The first cork layer is called "male cork" or "virgin cork", is still not very elastic and cracked and is only used for insulating mats. The second harvested cork (known as secundeira), has a more regular structure and is softer, but is still only used for insulation and in decorative objects. Only the following cork harvests deliver a higher quality cork, the "female cork", which can be used commercially in full. The best quality cork is obtained from the third and fourth harvest. Cork harvesting takes place every nine to twelve years when a layer thickness of 2.7 to 4\xa0cm (1 to 1+1⁄2\xa0in) is reached. Under favorable (warm) conditions, the harvest can take place every eight years, in North Africa every seven years. A cork oak can be harvested five to seventeen times in total. In order to minimize the damage to the trunk surface, harvesting can be carried out every three years, whereby only a third of the usable surface is removed. An important maintenance measure is pruning, which begins around the age of ten at a height of about 3\xa0m (10\xa0ft). Some sources say an oak can provide around 100 to 200 kilograms (220 to 440 pounds) of cork over its lifespan, and one hectare around 200 to 500\xa0kg (440 to 1,100\xa0lb) per year while others suggest a single tree can produce on average 40 to 60\xa0kg (88 to 132\xa0lb) of cork per harvest, a comparatively higher value, as cork oaks can live more than 200 years in good conditions.\n\nThe cork is mainly used for the production of stoppers and corks, as well as for heat and sound insulation, cork\npaper, badminton shuttlecocks, cricket balls, handles of fishing rods and hand tools, special devices for the space industry and for other technical applications (including composite materials, shoe soles, floor coverings). Bottle cork production accounts for around 70% of the added value in cork cultivation. Since natural corks are increasingly being replaced by plastic or sheet metal closures, there could be a significant decline in the cork oak population in southwestern Europe, which endangers the biodiversity in these areas.\n\nThe bark, which contains around twelve percent extractable tannin, is also used. In addition, the acorns are used as feed in extensive pig fattening (acorn fattening), such as for Iberian ham production; although the Holm Oak (Quercus ilex), is preferred for this due to its sweeter fruits. One cork oak tree can provide 15 to 30\xa0kg (33 to 66\xa0lb) of acorns per year.\n\nCork oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal, except for forest management felling of old, unproductive trees, and, even in those cases, farmers need special permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nCork harvesting is done entirely without machinery, being dependent solely on human labour. Usually five people[citation needed] are required to harvest the tree\'s bark, using a small axe. The process mandates specialized training due to the skill required to harvest bark without inflicting too much damage to the tree.\n\nThe European cork industry produces 300,000 tonnes of cork a year, with a value of €1.5 billion and employing 30,000 people. Wine corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.[citation needed]\n\nCork oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees, providing a minor income to their owners. The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament. Hybrids with Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) are not uncommon, both where their ranges overlap in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation; the hybrid Quercus × hispanica is known as Lucombe oak, for William Lucombe, who first identified it.\n\nSome cork is also produced in eastern Asia from the related Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis).[citation needed]\n\nThe cork oak is featured in the city arms of several cities in Portugal, such as the city of Reguengos de Monsaraz, which shows a freshly harvested cork tree.\n\nIn 2007, a 2 euro commemorative coin with the motif of a cork oak was issued in Portugal in memory of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union.\n\nIn the Portuguese town of Águas de Moura lies the Sobreiro Monumental (Monumental Cork Oak), also known as \'The Whistler Tree\', a tree 236 years old (planted in 1783/1784), over 14 metres (46\xa0ft) tall and with a trunk that requires at least three people to embrace it. It has been considered a National Monument since 1988, and Guinness World Records lists it as the largest cork tree in the world.', 'score': 9.331499}, {'id': 'Cynanchum_nigrum', 'name': ['Cynanchum nigrum'], 'introduction': "\n\nVincetoxicum nigrum, a species in the family Apocynaceae, also known as black swallow-wort, Louise's swallow-wort, or black dog-strangling vine, is a species of plant that is native to Europe and is found primarily in Italy, France, Portugal, and Spain. It is an invasive plant species in the northeastern United States, parts of the Midwest, southeastern Canada, and California. In 2020, wild plants were found in Timaru, New Zealand.", 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'conservation_status': 'Not found', 'sections': 'Vincetoxicum nigrum is a perennial, herbaceous vine bearing ovate leaves with pointed tips. The leaves are 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2\xa0cm) long, and 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6\xa0cm) wide, occurring in pairs on the stem. The flowers have five petals, and are star-shaped with white hairs. The flowers range in color from dark purple to black. The fruit of Vincetoxicum nigrum is a slender, tapered follicle that ranges in color from green through light brown and is tightly packed with seeds, each bearing a fluffy pappus to allow distribution by the wind.\n\nVincetoxicum nigrum tends to grow in upland areas and is tolerant to variable light, salt, and moisture levels. In the United States, the vine is often found in abandoned fields, hedgerows, brushy areas, woodlands, river banks, transportation corridors, quarries, agricultural fields, and gardens. In gardens, the plant is seen as a fast-growing weed.\n\nVincetoxicum nigrum emerges from an underground stem in the spring, and flowers during June and July. Vincetoxicum nigrum is self-pollinating, and follicles form throughout the summer. The number of follicles formed is directly linked to the amount of light the plant receives. If there is a lower level of light, then there are fewer follicles compared to a plant exposed to a higher level of light. The seeds begin to be released by mid-August, and continue to be dispersed by air currents into early October.\n\nEach seed is polyembryonic and contains about one to four embryos per seed, increasing Vincetoxicum nigrum\'s proliferation. Seeds have delicate fibrous "parachutes" used in wind dispersal over long distances. In addition to seeds for reproduction, Vincetoxicum nigrum also uses rhizomes as a method of propagation, meaning that the plant clones itself underground and produces new plants. After seed dispersal, the plant dies to the ground in the winter, reappearing in the spring.\n\nThe first sighting of Vincetoxicum nigrum in North America was recorded in Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1854. In 1864, a plant collector recorded that it was "escaping from the botanical garden where it is a weed promising to be naturalized". Vincetoxicum nigrum escaped from a garden in the Cambridge area of Massachusetts and naturalized in the surrounding states and is still spreading today. Massachusetts and New York classify the plant as an invasive species. Beyond the northeastern US, the plant has been reported in Wisconsin and California.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Vincetoxicum nigrum is a threat to native species because it crowds them out. For example, it can completely replace a field of native goldenrod. Crowding out other species results in a reduced habitat for wildlife, which may become endangered because they can no longer find their optimal habitat.\n\nVincetoxicum nigrum threatens the rare limestone pavement barren ecosystems by crowding out plants that the native wildlife needs to survive. It may also decrease bird presence in grasslands, which may in turn cause certain insect species populations to increase.\n\nIn Vermont, Vincetoxicum nigrum crowds out the endangered species Jesup\'s milk vetch (Astragalus robbinsii var. jesupii). In Rhode Island, Vincetoxicum nigrum has been reported as reducing the effectiveness of electric fences, which may allow livestock to be put into danger or lost.\n\nIn addition, Vincetoxicum nigrum crowds out a species of milkweed that monarch butterflies use as their larval food plant. Thus, the spread of this plant threatens populations of monarch butterflies. Overall, Vincetoxicum nigrum reproduces very prolifically, and can easily take over various habitats in a short time. Most of the possible implications of  Vincetoxicum nigrum\'s changing the structure of various ecosystems have not yet been studied.\n\nThere are four methods of management that can possibly be used for the management of Vincetoxicum nigrum. These methods are chemical, manual, mechanical, and biological. Only the chemical, manual, mechanical methods are actually used in the United States and Canada. The biological method may be used in the future. Overall, early detection and removal is the best management strategy.\n\nThe best chemical management of Vincetoxicum nigrum is through the use of systemic herbicides which prevent seeds from being viable. Garlon 4 (triclopyr) and  RoundUp Pro (glyphosate) are the main systemic herbicides that are used to control the vine. The systemic herbicide is most effective when sprayed on the plant after flowering has begun. If the herbicide is used after follicles have formed, it is less effective because viable seeds may still form. The most effective treatment using systemic herbicides is through a cut stem application, consisting of applying the chemical to the recently-cut stems of the swallow-wort vines.\n\nManual management is the removal of Vincetoxicum nigrum from the ground by digging up its rhizomes so that the plant cannot reproduce. The vine has an extensive rhizome system which must be completely removed to prevent new shoots from growing.  Trying to remove the vine by pulling will often cause the plant to detach from its rhizome, allowing the vine to continue to grow new shoots.   Seed pods must be disposed of carefully, to avoid inadvertently spreading the seeds to new areas.\n\nMechanical management is the mowing down of Vincetoxicum nigrum. This method does not stop growth, but it does stop seed crops. No seed crop means that the plant has no offspring.\n\nBiological management is the use of the vine\'s natural enemies to stop the spread and diminish the population of Vincetoxicum nigrum.  In the United States, Vincetoxicum nigrum has no natural enemies, but in its native Europe, certain caterpillars, beetles, and diseases attack the plant. Researchers at Cornell University and the USDA have investigated the use of natural enemies as a way to control the plant. The use of natural enemies is controversial, because the implications of adding more non-native species to threatened areas is unknown. In 2014 Hypena caterpillars were released in Ontario, Canada to help control Vincetoxicum\'s spread.', 'score': 9.30052}, {'id': 'Agraphis_patula', 'name': ['Agraphis patula'], 'introduction': '\n\nHyacinthoides hispanica (syn.

A 1996 review of the term\'s history from its first recorded usage in 1697 concluded that the species\' physical characteristics were frequently connected to "mainstay caricatures of anti-Semitic beliefs", whereas the interpretation that the fish was regarded as kosher food had little support. Alternate explanations include derivation from the Italian word "giupesce", which means "bottom fish", or mispronunciation of the name "jawfish". In 1927, the New York Aquarium changed the fish\'s name to Junefish after protests. In 2001, the American Fisheries Society changed the name to "goliath grouper" after complaints that the nickname was culturally insensitive.\n\nThe Atlantic goliath grouper can grow to lengths of 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) and weigh up to 363 kilograms (800 pounds). The species ranges in coloration from brownish yellow to grey to greenish and has small black dots on the head, body and fins. Individuals less than 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length have 3 to 4 faint vertical bars present on their sides. The species has an elongate body with a broad, flat head and small eyes. The lower jaw has 3 to 5 rows of teeth with no front canines. The scales are ctenoid. The dorsal fins are continuous with the rays of the soft dorsal fin being longer than the spines of the first dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are rounded and notably larger than the pelvic fins. The caudal fin is also rounded. The species typically preys on slow moving fish and crustaceans.\n\nAdult individuals are typically found in rocky reefs, wrecks, artificial reefs, and oil platforms. The species can also be found in coral reef habitats, but are much more abundant in rocky reef environments. Juveniles mainly inhabit mangrove environments, but can also be found in holes and under ledges of swift tidal creeks that drain mangroves. Mangroves serve as an essential nursery habitat for the Atlantic goliath grouper and provide specific suitable water conditions to nurture healthy, sustained goliath grouper populations. Juvenile goliath groupers may remain in mangrove nursery habitats for 5 to 6 years before leaving towards deeper offshore reef habitats at around 1 meter in length.\n\nThe Atlantic goliath grouper has a longevity of 37 years and reaches first maturity after 6 years, which leads to an estimated generation length of 21.5 years. The species has been hypothesized to be protogynous hermaphrodites, but this has yet to be confirmed. Males become sexually mature at around 115 centimeters (45\xa0in) in length, and at ages 4–6. Females mature at around 125 centimeters (49\xa0in), and at ages 6–8. The species has relatively small spawning aggregations of less than 150 individuals with no evidence of spawning outside of these aggregations.\n\nAtlantic goliath groupers are highly susceptible to rapid population decline due to overfishing and the exploitation of spawning aggregations. The species has a brief annual larval settlement period, making the species\' abundance extremely vulnerable to outside factors such as poor weather conditions. High mercury concentrations in older males may lead to liver damage and/or death and reduce egg viability. The degradation of mangroves, which serve as an important nursery habitat for the species provide a major threat to juvenile survival. The species was previously classified as critically endangered in 2011 and is currently classified as vulnerable in 2021. A 2016 stock assessment model indicates that there has been an absolute population reduction of around 33% from 1950 to 2014. There has been a complete moratorium on the fishing of this species in continental U.S. waters since 1990 and in U.S. Caribbean waters since 1993.\n\nIn October 2021, Florida Fish and Wildlife proposed to allow the fishing of 200 juvenile goliath grouper per year including up to 50 from Everglades National Park.

The most widely distributed member of the otter subfamily (Lutrinae) of the weasel family (Mustelidae), it is found in the waterways and coasts of Europe, many parts of Asia, and parts of northern Africa.

Brown above and cream below, these long, slender creatures are well-equipped for their aquatic habits. Their bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy. This otter differs from the North American river otter by its shorter neck, broader visage, the greater space between the ears and its longer tail. However, the Eurasian otter is the only otter in much of its range, so it is rarely confused for any other animal. Normally, this species is 57 to 95\xa0cm (22.5 to 37.5\xa0in) long, not counting a tail of 35–45\xa0cm (14–17.5\xa0in). The female is shorter than the male.  The otter\'s average body weight is 7 to 12\xa0kg (15 to 26\xa0lb), although occasionally a large old male may reach up to 17\xa0kg (37\xa0lb). The record-sized specimen, reported by a reliable source but not verified, weighed over 24\xa0kg (53\xa0lb).\n\nThe Eurasian otter is the most widely distributed otter species, its range including parts of Asia and northern Africa, as well as being spread across Europe, south to Palestine. Though currently thought to be extinct in Liechtenstein and Switzerland, it is now common in Latvia, along the coast of Norway, in the western regions of Spain and Portugal and across Great Britain and Ireland. In Italy, it lives in southern parts of the peninsula.\nIt inhabits unpolluted bodies of fresh water such as lakes, streams, rivers, canals and ponds, as long as the food supply is adequate. In Andalusia, it uses artificial lakes on golf courses. It prefers the open areas of the streams and also lives along the coast in salt water, but requires regular access to fresh water to clean its fur.\n\nIn Syria, the Eurasian otter was recorded in montane creeks in Latakia and Raqqa Governorates and in the lower Euphrates valley in Deir ez-Zor Governorate.\nIn western Nepal, its presence was documented at elevations of around 1,600\xa0m (5,200\xa0ft) in Barekot river in Jajarkot District and at 1,337\xa0m (4,386\xa0ft) in Tubang river in Eastern Rukum District.\nIn India, it is distributed in the Himalayan foothills, southern Western Ghats and the central Indian landscape.\n\nThe Eurasian otter\'s diet mainly consists of fish. Fish is its most preferred choice of food in Mediterranean and temperate freshwater habitats. During the winter and in colder environments, it also feeds on amphibians, worms, clams, crustaceans, insects, eggs, birds and sometimes small mammals, including young European beavers. It will also feed on a small amount of vegetation.\n\nAs with various other mustelid species, otters are capable of overpowering and killing prey significantly larger than themselves, and are known to hunt large waterbirds such as adult greylag geese on occasion.\n\nEurasian otters are strongly territorial, living alone for the most part. An individual\'s territory may vary between about 1 and 40\xa0km (1–25\xa0mi) long, with about 18\xa0km (11\xa0mi) being usual. The length of the territory depends on the density of food available and the width of the water suitable for hunting (it is shorter on coasts, where the available width is much wider, and longer on narrower rivers). The Eurasian otter uses its feces, called spraints, to mark its territory and prioritize the use of resources to other group members. The territories are only held against members of the same sex, so those of males and females may overlap. Mating takes place in water. Eurasian otters are nonseasonal breeders (males and females will breed at any time of the year) and it has been found that their mating season is most likely determined simply by the otters\' reproductive maturity and physiological state. Female otters become sexually mature between 18 and 24 months old and the average age of first breeding is found to be 2+1⁄2 years. Gestation for the Eurasian otter is 60–64 days, the litter weighing about 10% of the female body mass. After the gestation period, one to four pups are born, which remain dependent on the mother for about 13 months. The male plays no direct role in parental care, although the territory of a female with her pups is usually entirely within that of the male. Hunting mainly takes place at night, while the day is usually spent in the Eurasian otter\'s holt (den)\xa0– usually a burrow or hollow tree on the riverbank which can sometimes only be entered from underwater. Though long thought to hunt using sight and touch only, evidence is emerging that they may also be able to smell underwater – possibly in a similar manner to the star-nosed mole.\n\nThe extinct Japanese otter is sometimes considered a subspecies; recent studies have found it to fall outside the subspecific clades comprising L. lutra, so it has been reclassified as a distinct species, but significant uncertainty remains.\n\nThe Eurasian otter declined across its range in the second half of the 20th century primarily due to pollution from polychlorinated biphenyls and pesticides such as organochlorine. Other threats included habitat loss and hunting, both legal and illegal. Eurasian otter populations are now recovering in many parts of Europe. In the United Kingdom, the number of sites with an otter presence increased by 55% between 1994 and 2002. In August, 2011, the Environment Agency announced that otters had returned to every county in England since vanishing from every county except the West Country and parts of Northern England. Recovery is partly due to a ban on the most harmful pesticides that has been in place across Europe since 1979, partly to improvements in water quality leading to increases in prey populations, and partly to direct legal protection under the European Union Habitats Directive and national legislation in several European countries. In Hong Kong, it is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170. It is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List.\n\nIn Germany, the Eurasian otter is nearly extinct in the wild, being listed as critically endangered. As part of a protection and conservation effort the "Aktion Fischotterschutz" was founded in 1979, which aims to fund habitat protection and expansion. Further, the Hankensbüttler Otter Centre provides protection to the species in captivity.\n\nIt is listed as endangered in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand, and critically endangered in Mongolia. In South Korea, it is listed as a Natural Monument and first-class endangered species.\n\nMost species that are victims of population decline or a loss of habitat tend to eventually lose their genetic difference due to inbreeding from small populations. A study conducted in 2001, examined whether or not the populations of Eurasian otters suffered from a lack of genetic variability. In the study, they examined teeth of otter skulls at the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen and the Natural History Museum, Aarhus. The samples were collected between 1883 and 1963 in Denmark (Funen, Zealand, and Jutland). The study examined the tissue on the teeth of the skulls and determined the genetic variability based on DNA analysis. In conclusion, the study discovered that despite the population declines, the Eurasian otter was not a victim of declining genetic variability.\n\nThe decline in population of native freshwater fishes in the rivers of Iberia, which is the preferred food of Eurasian otters, along with the expansion of exotic fish species like centrarchids could potentially put Eurasian otters at risk for extinction.', 'score': 8.644257}, {'id': 'Alytes_cisternasii', 'name': ['Alytes cisternasii'], 'introduction': '\n\nAmmoryctis cisternasii — Lataste, 1879\n\nThe Iberian midwife toad or brown midwife toad (Alytes cisternasii), in Portuguese sapo-parteiro-ibérico, is a species of frog in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae) found in Portugal and western Spain.

Its closest relative is the lesser yellowlegs, a much smaller bird with a very different appearance apart from the fine, clear, and dense pattern of the neck, which both species show in breeding plumage. It breeds in North America and the West Indies and winters in southern North America, Central America, the West Indies and South America.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'conservation_status': 'Least Concern', 'sections': 'The willet was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus\'s Systema Naturae. He placed it in the genus Scolopax and coined the binomial name Scolopax semipalmata. Gmelin based his description on the "semipalmated snipe" from New York that had been described in 1785 by both the English ornithologist John Latham and by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. The willet was formerly assigned to the genus Catoptrosorus  that had been introduced for the species in 1827 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte. In 2006 it was moved to the current genus Tringa based on a molecular phylogenetic study published the previous year. The genus name Tringa is the Neo-Latin word given to the green sandpiper by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific epithet semipalmata combines the Latin semi- meaning "half" or "small" with palmatus meaning "palmate".\n\nTwo subspecies are recognised:\n\nIt has been suggested that the two subspecies be treated as separate species as there are clear differences in distribution, behavior, morphology, and genetics, but this has yet to be widely adopted.\n\nThe willet is a very rare vagrant to Europe with records from the Azores, mainland Portugal, France, Norway and Finland. The Portuguese record from Alcochete near Lisbon on 29 April 2009 showed characteristics of the eastern subspecies.\n\nThe willet is an inelegant and heavily built shorebird with a structure similar to that of the common redshank but being larger in size than the greater yellowlegs while resembling a godwit in flight with black primary coverts and primaries contrasting with a broad white band, white secondaries with a white rump and gray tail band. With its reclassification into the Tringa genus, it stands as the largest species in this prominent sandpiper genus. It is 31–41\xa0cm (12–16\xa0in) in overall length and weighs 200–330\xa0g (7.1–11.6\xa0oz). The sexes are similar in plumage but the female is slightly larger.\n\nThe black underwing coverts may be conspicuous in flight. Willets are identified on the ground by their gray legs and shortish, heavy but straight bill. The plumage is gray above with a white rump, and white below with a distinct white area above the lores and a narrow whitish eye ring giving the bird a spectacled appearance. The underparts are white. In breeding plumage, the bird shows brown barring on the upperparts. Non-breeding birds are plainer.\n\nThe willet\'s name is onomatopoeic and refers to its loud piercing "pill-will-willet" territorial song., which is higher pitched and repeated at a faster rate in Eastern willets than in Western birds. Other calls include a predator response call given by breeding birds which is a repeated, staccato "kleep", while non breeding birds alarms include a high, pitched anxious "kip-kip-viek" call and a "kreei" call. They also have a distinctive call when crossing another willet\'s territory and this "klay-dir" call is also used as a contact call when willets are migrating.\n\nTwo subspecies (which may actually be different species) have very different breeding habitats. The eastern willet breeds in coastal saltmarshes while the western willet breeds in freshwater prairie marshes, sloughs, potholes and other inland wetlands. In winter both subspecies are coastal birds being found on both rocky and sandy coasts as well as on mudflats and in coastal marshes.\n\nThey are territorial both on the breeding grounds and on the wintering areas but form loose breeding colonies or wintering groups. When displaying the wings are held stiffly and downcurved in flight while on the ground the display gives prominence to the distinctive pattern of the underwings. They are normally vigilant birds, with the birds closer to the landward edge of a saltmarsh being the first to utter their alarm calls, in a manner reminiscent of the common redshank in Europe, although some individuals may be approachable.\n\nWillets are flexible in their feeding habits and hunt by walking steadily and pecking prey from the substrate, although they also probe into the mud or silt with their sensitive bill and may actively stalk larger prey in shallow water. A favored prey on the coasts is small fiddler crabs as well as mole crabs, worms, clams and other invertebrates.  They have also been known to occasionally eat plant material. Willets also actively hunt more mobile prey such as fish and aquatic insects in the water and will wade up to their bellies to pursue such prey. Prey recorded in western willets during breeding include water scavenger beetles (Hydrophilidae), diving beetles (Dytiscidae), snout beetles (Curculionidae), spiders (Araneae) and fish (Cypriniformes). In winter, western willets have been recorded eating shore crabs (Hemigrapsus), brachyuran crabs (Uca princeps, Leptuca crenulata), crabs (Pachygrapsus), clams (Macoma, Gemma gemma), nereid worms (Neanthes), mussels (Mytilus), whelks (Nassariidae) and others. Eastern willets eat primarily marine coastal prey, including fiddler crabs (Minuca minax, Minuca pugnax, Leptuca pugilator), other crabs (Armases cinereum, Sesarma reticulatum), mole crabs (Emerita talpoida), amphipods (Corophium volutator) and other marine invertebrates. The sensitive bill means that willets can hunt at night as well as during the day. They often use rocks, trees or fence posts to perch on.\n\nThe male normally leads the female through the territory and creates trial nest scrapes for the female to consider until she selects the site. The nest is a shallow depression scraped out by the birds using their feet and breast, it measures 15\xa0cm across and 5\xa0cm deep. It is placed among grass close to the water\'s edge in western willets and in saltmarsh or sand dunes in eastern willets. If the nest is placed among grass the female may pull grass stalks over the nest for camouflage. Fine grass leaves and small pebbles may be used to line the nest and grass lining may be brought from some distance where the nest is on bare ground. The male and female may form a long-term monogamous bond and return to the same territory in successive breeding seasons. The male defends the territory from other willets, challenging his neighbors with a ritualized walk along the mutual boundary of their territory, and often this leads to fights. Both sexes incubate the eggs for 22–29 days, although the male tends to incubate at night, the female departs from the territory before the precocial young are fledged leaving them in the care of the male for the last two weeks or so before they fledge.\n\nThe willet is still common in some parts of its range despite an apparent decline since the 1960s. It is also considered to be a species at risk of becoming threatened or endangered without conservation action. The western subspecies is threatened by the conversion of native grasslands and drainage of wetlands for agriculture while the wintering habitat has been degraded locally in California by coastal development. Willets are also vulnerable to being killed by colliding with power lines laid through their wetland breeding areas. The passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 protected the willet from intensive exploitation by hunters for food and allowed its numbers to rebound to present levels. There are a total of 250,000 willets in North America, of which 150,000 were counted from the western flyway, and 90,000 in the eastern. Since the Western willet winters in the east, that means that there are probably much less than 90,000 Eastern willets.', 'score': 8.477644}, {'id': 'Alytes_obstetricans', 'name': ['Alytes obstetricans'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) is a species of midwife frog in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae). It is found in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (although, in the latter, only as an introduction). Like other members of its genus (Alytes), the male toad carries the eggs around entwined on his back and thighs until they are ready to hatch.\n\nIts natural habitats are temperate forests, dry forests, shrubland, rivers, freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, temperate desert, arable land, pastureland and urban areas. It is threatened by habitat loss.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'conservation_status': 'Least Concern', 'sections': "The common midwife toad can grow to a length of 5.5 centimetres (2.2\xa0in) but is usually rather smaller than this, the females generally being larger than the males. It is broad and stocky and has a large head with prominent eyes, the pupils being vertical slits. The skin is mostly smooth with a few small warts and granules and a row of large warts down either side. The parotoid glands are small and there are additional glands in the under arm and ankle regions. There are three tubercles on each metacarpal. The colour is quite variable, often being grey, olive or brown, sometimes speckled with small greenish or brown spots. The large warts are often reddish or yellow. The underside is pale grey often with spots of darker grey on the throat and chest.\n\nThe common midwife toad is found in a number of countries in north west Europe. It is common throughout France and is also found in southern Belgium and the Netherlands, Luxembourg, western Germany and northern and western Switzerland. There are some disconnected outlying populations in Portugal and northern Spain. In the Pyrenees it is found at altitudes of up to 2,400 metres (7,900\xa0ft). It is usually found not far from water but sometimes wanders 500 metres (1,600\xa0ft) away, often living in sunny locations. These include hilly areas, cultivated land, quarries, rocky slopes, gravel pits, woods, parks and gardens. It is active at dusk and through the night, spending the day hidden in undergrowth, in crevices or under logs or stones in a place where it can keep damp. It can dig a burrow with its fore limbs in which to lie and spends the winter hibernating on land. Research has demonstrated that four of the introduced populations in Bedfordshire, England have the same origin, through sequencing of 16S and COI gene sequences. However, due to limitations in the reference database, the researchers can't be sure of the exact location of origin. Researchers have noted a number of limb deformities in the introduced populations found throughout the United Kingdom, which are likely linked to small founder population sizes.\n\nThe common midwife toad, (Alytes obstetricans) has four subspecies within its distribution, A. o. almogavarii, A. o. boscai, A. o. obstetricans, and A. o. pertinax. A. o. obstetricans is the subspecies with the largest distribution, spreading from the Iberian Peninsula northward into the rest of its range. The other three subspecies are local to the Iberian Peninsula. These subspecies formed during glacial refugia conditions during the Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Due to the genetic differences of these populations, their individual conservation is highly important. Recently, A. o. almogavarii has been recommended as an independent incipient species Alytes almogavarii as it has been shown to be moving towards total impermeable gene flow.\n\nWhen threatened, the midwife toad inflates, filling itself with air so as to make it appear as large as possible. It may also rear up on all four limbs, raise its rump and stand in a threatening posture with its head down and eyes shut.\n\nReproduction takes place in spring and summer. The female seeks out a male and invites him to mate. Females are more prone to selecting larger males due to fitness preference. He proceeds to hold her round the flanks and uses his toes to stimulate her cloaca. After about half an hour he squeezes her sides firmly, whereby she stretches her hind legs and ejects a mass of eggs embedded in strings of jelly. The male releases her and inseminates the egg mass with his sperm. A little later, he begins to pull and pummel the egg mass, teasing it out so that he can wrap the strings around his back legs. He can mate again while the eggs are twined round his limbs and can carry up to three clutches of eggs at a time, a total of about 150 eggs. He looks after them until they hatch, in 3 to 8 weeks. He keeps them moist by lying up in a damp place during the day and by going for a swim if there is risk of them drying out. He may secrete a substance through the skin that protects the eggs from infection. When the eggs are about to hatch, he detaches them in a calm stretch of water like a ditch, village pond, spring or drinking trough. There is evidence that suggests that this may include temporary water bodies, such as those found within flowerpot saucers in urban gardens. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which feed and grow over the course of several months, develop limbs, lose their tails and eventually undergo metamorphosis into juvenile toads. They may overwinter as tadpoles, becoming exceptionally large in the process.\n\nCommon midwife toads feed mostly on insects and other arthropods, as well as carrion.\n\nThe 1971 book by Arthur Koestler The Case of the Midwife Toad, brought the species a role in new thinking on the development of scientific paradigms based on the case of Paul Kammerer who claimed to have shown Lamarckian inheritance in experiments with the toad.", 'score': 8.465536}, {'id': 'Mucor_fragilis', 'name': ['Mucor fragilis'], 'introduction': '\n\nMucor fragilis is an endophytic fungus that causes the mold that can be found on grapes, pole beans, loquat, and on the roots of medicinal plants like Radix pseudostellariae.

Mucor fragilis reproduces asexually and the sporangiophores are found as two types: simple and sympodially branched. Sporangiophores are mostly sympodially branched and grow to a width of around 6–12\xa0μm and have a variable length. These sporangiophores have globose to subglobose, multispored, light yellow sporangia on them that measure around 24.5–49.5 by 22.5–48\xa0μm. The columellae of Mucor fragilis can be globose to ellipsoid, pyriform, or some conical and can measure around 17.5–30 by 16–29.5\xa0μm.

It is distributed worldwide in places like Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Kenya, Korea, Lithuania, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. It is known in 3 of the 26 states in Brazil.\n\nMucor fragilis is causing rot on lots of plant species in China and Pakistan. It has been found on grapes in five different locations of fruit markets after harvest in Pakistan and has causes a decline in the market value of grapes. Thyme oil has been found to potentially increase the shelf-life of these grapes. Also in Pakistan, Mucor fragilis has been causing rot in seychelles pole beans. This is the first time this fungus has been seen on pole beans and is causing urgency to control this fungus so it does not spread. In China, Mucor fragilis has been found on one of China's highly prized medicinal plants (Radix pseudostellariae). This is also the first report of Mucor fragilis causing rot on this plant and could result in loss of production of this medical plant. Mucor fragilis was found on deceased adult reproductive female brown widow spiders (Latrodectus geometricus) in North Central Florida. Spiders first showed signs of reduced foraging behavior and then started to die, this confirms that Mucor fragilis is pathogenic to these spiders. Mucor fragilis releases spores that can infect species like these spiders in multiple ways such as in their food or wound exposure. A study done on enzymes from Mucor fragilis grown on bovine blood provides a discussion on how this fungus be helpful to study structures on glycoconjugates containing certain glycoproteins. The view is that blood has nutritional value and is wasted when producing meat and the goal was to find a way to reuse this biomass and with a little more research, enzymes of Mucor fragilis may be the answer to the problem.\n\nMucor fragilis can produce simultaneously two bioactive metabolites, podophyllotoxin and kaempferol, as its host plant. This is very significant for this fungus as podophyllotoxin is in great demand due to its use as an anticancer and antivirus drug precursor. As the podophyllum plant is endangered, having Mucor fragilis produce podophyllotoxin can help increase the production of podophyllotoxin and also help the endangered podophyllum plant from going extinct.

M.\xa0escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.\xa0nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.\xa0escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.\n\nM.\xa0escalerai is a medium-sized, mostly gray bat, with lighter underparts.

He named the new species after the Spanish entomologist Manuel Martínez de la Escalera, who collected two specimens of the species in Bellver, Catalonia. Cabrera did not designate either of the two localities (Bellver and Foios, Valencia) as the type locality, and later authors have listed both. Currently, Foios, which was listed first by Cabrera, is accepted as the type locality. Cabrera commented that M.\xa0escalerai was close to Natterer\'s bat (Myotis nattereri), and in 1912, Gerrit S. Miller listed escalerai as a synonym of that species. He argued that one of the features Cabrera had listed as distinguishing the two was an artefact of the preservation of the specimens of M.\xa0escalerai in alcohol. Miller\'s classification was followed for almost a century, and indeed, Cabrera himself accepted in 1914 that M.\xa0escalerai was not a valid species.\n\nMyotis nattereri\n\nMyotis crypticus and Myotis sp.\xa0C (see text)\n\nMyotis schaubi\n\nMyotis escalerai\n\nMyotis zenatius\n\nHowever, a 2006 study by Carlos Ibáñez and colleagues found that M.\xa0nattereri in fact included several cryptic species with highly distinguished DNA sequences characteristics, even though morphological differences were small or nonexistent. One, which they recorded in the southern Iberian Peninsula, was identified as M.\xa0escalerai. Populations in the mountains of northern Spain represent another species (now known to be Myotis crypticus), which is now also known from the Alps. A 2009 study using data from the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b and ND1 found that M.\xa0escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco previously included in M.\xa0nattereri (now known to be Myotis zenatius), and more distantly to other members of the Myotis nattereri group.</ref> M.\xa0escalerai and M. zenatius are estimated to have diverged about 2 million years ago. Later in 2009, M.\xa0escalerai was also recorded for the first time from France. One 2011 study found a fifth putative species in the complex ("Myotis sp.\xa0C"), occurring in the Italian peninsula and most closely related to M. crypticus, but another study published in the same year included these populations in M. crypticus. The latter study, by I. Salicini and colleagues, used sequences from six nuclear genes to confirm the distinctiveness of M.\xa0escalerai and its close relationship with M.\xa0zenatius.\n\nA medium-sized gray bat, Myotis escalerai is similar to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection on the inner side of the outer ear, is long and reaches to the middle of the ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.\xa0nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.\n\nThe head body length is 42 to 50\xa0mm (1.7 to 2.0\xa0in), tail length is 38 to 47\xa0mm (1.5 to 1.9\xa0in), forearm length is 35 to 43\xa0mm (1.4 to 1.7\xa0in), ear length is 14 to 18\xa0mm (0.55 to 0.71\xa0in), wingspan is 245 to 300\xa0mm (9.6 to 11.8\xa0in), and body mass is 5 to 9.5\xa0g (0.18 to 0.34\xa0oz).\n\nThe range of Myotis escalerai remains poorly constrained and may turn out to be larger than currently known. M.\xa0escalerai is widespread in Spain and Portugal. For example, it occurs widely, though localized, in Aragón, where Myotis sp.\xa0A (the only other species in the M.\xa0nattereri complex to occur there) is known from a single locality only. Similarly, in Catalonia, M.\xa0escalerai is widespread and occurs from sea level up to an altitude of 1,500\xa0m (4,900\xa0ft). The species also occurs on the Balearic Islands of Mallorca, Menorca, and Ibiza. The sole French record is from a cave in Valmanya, Pyrénées-Orientales.\n\nRelatively little is known of the biology of M.\xa0escalerai. Females begin to form reproductive colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.\xa0escalerai from M.\xa0nattereri as well as M.\xa0sp.\xa0A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed in a variety of structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between 0 and 5\xa0°C (32 and 41\xa0°F), and are usually located in caves or basements. M.\xa0escalerai is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. Rabies has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.\xa0escalerai.\n\nThe IUCN Red List classifies Myotis escalerai as "near threatened". M. nattereri and M. escalerai are also listed separately on the Annex to the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats. Portugal lists M.\xa0escalerai as "vulnerable", though noting that populations may be increasing. Because of its restriction to caves, it is considered vulnerable in Aragón. In Catalonia, the species appears tolerant of different habitats and of human disturbance, but it is listed as "data deficient". In France, where the species was only discovered in 2009, it is also listed as "data deficient".', 'score': 8.186493}, {'id': 'Acridotheres_cristatellus', 'name': ['Acridotheres cristatellus'], 'introduction': '\n\nGracula cristatella Linnaeus,\xa01758\n\nThe crested myna (Acridotheres cristatellus), also known as the Chinese starling, is a species of starling in the genus Acridotheres native to southeastern China and Indochina. It is named after the tuft of feathers on its forehead that resembles a crest.\n\nThe crested myna is typically found in open spaces near urban and agricultural areas. It is a popular cage bird and, as a result, has been accidentally released in a few places outside of its usual range. For example, this species was introduced around 1890 into the Vancouver region of British Columbia. It was initially successful, reaching a population in the thousands, however, it has since then gone locally extinct in the area.\n\nLike many starlings, the crested myna is omnivorous. It will eat a variety of food including worms, grubs, grains, fruit, and even garbage. It is a highly beneficial bird to farmers, as it feeds on insects and does not attack crops.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'conservation_status': 'Least Concern', 'sections': 'In 1743 the English naturalist George Edwards included a picture and a description of the crested myna in his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds. He used the English name "Chinese starling or Black Bird". When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the tenth edition, he placed the crested myna with the other mynas in the genus Gracula. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Gracula cristatella and cited Edwards\' work.  The specific epithet cristatella is a Latin diminutive of cristatus meaning\n"crested" or "plumed". The crested myna is now placed in the genus Acridotheres that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. It was previously placed in the genus Aethiospar, which included the mynas that had a fully feathered or tufted face. Acridotheres was formerly the group of bare-skin faced mynas. Now, the two genera form a new group that keeps the name Acridotheres.\n\nThree subspecies are recognised:\n\nThe crested myna is named after the tuft of feathers that form a crest-like structure on its forehead that covers the bird\'s nostrils. It is mostly black with a slight green sheen. It has a couple of white wing patches under its wings which are more visible during flight. The tips and the base of the primaries are white. The tail feathers also have white tips with the exception of the middle pair. The under-tail coverts are black with a white tip. The adult\'s eyes are orange, its bill is pale yellow, and its legs are a dull dark yellow. Its bill is slender and very sharp. The males are slightly larger than the females. The female\'s crest is slightly less well-developed. Otherwise, there is no sexual dimorphism. The subspecies A. c. brevipennis, has proportionally smaller wings and a smaller bill. The feathers that form the crest are narrower than the ones from the nominate subspecies. A. c. formosanus is slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and its bill is greenish-yellow. Its under-tail coverts are white and it has a more developed crest.\n\nThe hatchlings are born naked except for of a short gray down found on certain parts of the bird. In about 18 to 20 days, the juveniles become fully covered with brown feathers. The crest is usually not well developed at this stage. Immature crested mynas have blue-gray eyes.\n\nThe crested myna can be found in a wide range of habitats from urban to rural areas. In cities, it can be seen in the eaves of buildings, along roads and alleys, near gardens and parks, in parking lots. It can be found under bridges, in trees, in chimneys, and on roofs. In rural areas, it can be spotted on agricultural fields, in orchards and farmyards, near manure piles. It can be seen near plowed fields to take advantage of the invertebrates found in the tilled soil. It is often seen near cattle as it eats the insects around them. It is also commonly distributed in grasslands, fields and at the edge of forests.\n\nThe range spans from southeastern and central China to northern Indochina. It is found in the Yangtze valley and the southeastern Jiangxi Province in China. The crested myna has also been recorded in Burma, Taiwan and Hainan.\n\nAs a popular cage bird, it is often transported outside of its normal range and, on occasion, can be accidentally released and introduced in a new area. For example, in the late 1800s, it was introduced to Vancouver, British Columbia. It was able to proliferate and its population grew to around 20,000 to 30,000 individuals. It could be found anywhere from the south of the province to Washington and Oregon. By the mid-20th century, the numbers began declining, and the bird is now extirpated in North America. Other examples of the crested myna\'s introduction can be seen in Portugal. The bird was discovered breeding around Lisbon, Portugal in 1997. They are now established on both sides of the Tagus estuary to the west of Lisbon and also on the Setúbal Peninsula.\n\nThe crested myna has also been successfully introduced in Penang, Singapore, Manila, as well as parts of Japan and Argentina.\nThe Crested myna is called "Martinez" in the Philippines\n\n\n\nThe crested myna has a wide array of songs and calls, from whistles to warbles to chortles. When alarmed, it emits a raspy jaaay. Other calls include a series of chuffs or creeks. Vocal mimicry of human voices and other yard birds in crested mynas has been reported. However, birds held in captivity were not found to be good mimics.\n\nThe crested myna is an omnivorous bird. Although it eats mainly insects, this bird can eat a wide variety of items including fruit, grains, meat, manure and garbage.\n\nIts diet varies seasonally. On average, 40% of the adult bird\'s diet is meat and 60% is vegetation. However, in September, the proportion of meat in its diet increases to around 50–60%, where almost half of it is flies. In the winter months, as insects and fruit are less common, the crested myna eats a lot more garbage (representing about 15% of its diet).\n\nIts diet also varies with the life stages of the bird. Juveniles eat proportionally more animal matter than adults Approximately 75% of their diet is made of meat (50% of which is from insects). Similarly to adult crested mynas, the proportion of insects and fruit that the juveniles eat increases with availability and abundance.\n\nThe crested mynas build their nests in a variety of places. In a forest, it builds its nest in holes caused by woodpeckers or decay. In urban areas, the nests can be found in chimneys, drains, and crevices among other places. Most nests are built in April or May. Both the male and the female take part in the construction of the nest. To build the nest, the crested mynas have been known to use just about anything they can find from grass to branches to garbage.\n\nThe first clutch of the season appears during the end of April or during May. Most pairs are double-brooded, which means they will have a second clutch in the same season. The second clutch appears in June to mid-August. The eggs are of a light blue-green color and have a similar shape to that of robin eggs. Typically, the clutch size is around 4–6 eggs. Every day, one egg is hatched. The hatchlings are born altricially. The eggs are incubated for 14 days, after which the fledglings move out of the nest onto a nearby tree or shrub. The parents keep feeding them for about a week.\n\nThe immature crested mynas do not separate from their parents. They typically form small family groups and form a larger flock with others for feeding and traveling.\n\nSince 1998, the crested myna has been rated as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. It has a range that is larger than 20,000\xa0km2 and therefore, its range is too large for this bird to be considered vulnerable under the criterion of range size. Also, the population trends seem to be stable (over the last ten years or three generations) and so, this bird cannot be considered vulnerable under the criterion of population trends.

Both sexes look alike: mottled brown or black overall with a whitish-brown underbelly and thin, dirty-white fluff covering the head and neck. The base of the neck has a white collar, the eye is yellow or amber, the crop patch deep brown. The head does not have feathers. This is an adaptation that occurred because of the Rüppell vulture\'s tendency to stick its head inside of its prey when eating. Without the adaptation, feeding would become extremely messy. Silent as a rule, they become vocal at their nest and when at a carcass, squealing a great deal. Rüppell\'s vultures commonly fly at altitudes as high as 6,000\xa0m (20,000\xa0ft). The birds have a specialized variant of the hemoglobin alphaD subunit; this protein has a great affinity for oxygen, which allows the species to absorb oxygen efficiently despite the low partial pressure in the upper troposphere. A Rüppell\'s vulture was confirmed to have been ingested by a jet engine of an airplane flying over Abidjan, Ivory Coast on 29 November 1973 at an altitude of 11,300\xa0m (37,000\xa0ft).\n\nIt cruises at a speed of 35\xa0km/h (22\xa0mph), but flies for 6–7 hours every day and as far as 150\xa0km (93\xa0mi) from a nest site to find food.[citation needed]\n\nStrictly a carrion feeder, the Rüppell\'s vulture has been known to follow game herds on their seasonal migrations and feeds in large numbers at carcasses, usually with other Old World vulture species. Though it might take advantage of the remains of an animal killed by a lion, or other large predator, it can also feed on animals that have died from injuries, disease, or old age. Though they prefer freshly-killed meat, they can eat older carcasses without a problem. Rüppell\'s vultures have several adaptations to their diet and are specialized feeders even among the Old World vultures of Africa. They have an especially powerful build and, after the most attractive soft parts of a carcass have been consumed, they will continue with the hide, and even the bones, gorging themselves until they can barely fly. They have backward-pointing spikes on the tongue to help remove meat from bone. Despite their size, power and adaptations, they are not the most dominant vulture in their range; the most dominant species is considered to be the larger lappet-faced vulture.\n\nThis species of vulture is considered to be monogamous, forming lifelong breeding pairs. After courtship the pair will work together to build a nest using sticks, grass, and leaves that they have gathered or stolen from other nests. Rüppell\'s vultures build these nests on cliffs, and in key breeding areas they are known to nest in large colonies containing hundreds of breeding pairs. Both parents share in incubation of their egg over a period of 55 days. Once the chick hatches, both parents will feed and tend to it for about 150 days when it fledges. Young remain dependent on their parents after fledging, not reaching independence until the next breeding season.  During this time they learn how to find and compete for food.\n\nSince first being assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1988, populations of Rüppell\'s vulture have decreased. The species has been listed with an IUCN Red List status of "near threatened" since 2007, and populations are estimated to decline. From 2012 to 2014 the Rüppell\'s vulture was listed as Endangered; however, it was reassessed in 2015 as Critically Endangered.\n\nRüppell\'s vulture is currently listed as an Appendix II species under CITES, which regulates the international trade of animals and plants. Under this designation, the Rüppell\'s vulture is defined as not being immediately at risk of extinction, although the current population could become threatened without a careful regulation of trade.\n\nThe total population of Rüppell\'s vulture has been estimated to be somewhere around 22,000 individuals, with specific populations in the following areas: Tanzania (3,000 pairs); Kenya (2,000 pairs); Ethiopia (2,000 pairs); Sudan (2,000 pairs); and West Africa (2,000 pairs).\n\nSince 1992, Rüppell\'s vulture has been occurring as a vagrant in Spain and Portugal, with annual records since 1997, mainly in the Cádiz and Strait of Gibraltar area, but also further north.\n\nRüppell\'s vulture populations are experiencing declining populations throughout their entire range. These declines can be attributed to loss of habitat related to human-related land use, poisoning, human use for medicine or meat, loss of nesting sites, and declining availability of food sources. Poisoning is currently thought to be the most serious threat to all vulture populations in Africa, although they are not usually the intended target. In events where predators such as lions or hyenas have killed livestock, carbofuran poisons have been placed into carcasses as retaliation against the predators. Vultures utilize carrion as their main food source, and one carcass has the potential to attract hundreds of birds to feed because this species identifies food by sight. One evaluation of 10 poisoning events found that each event caused the death of 37 to 600 individuals.\n\nKilling of Rüppell\'s vultures for use in medicine has also greatly contributed to the rapid population decline. In many African cultures, vultures are used for medicine and magic related to superstitions that they are clairvoyant and can be used to increase a child\'s intelligence. Establishing protected wildlife areas is thought to be an effective route to protect the Rüppell\'s vulture from extinction. The Rüppell\'s vulture breed and nests in cliffs in northern and southern Kenya, as well as Tanzania. These breeding and nesting grounds amass huge numbers of Rüppell\'s vultures which will raise young and forage in the surrounding area. Considering that the detection rate of Rüppell\'s vultures was found to be lower in protected areas than outside of them, extending protection to these key breeding sites could help support their population.', 'score': 7.8774123}, {'id': 'Acacia_longifolia', 'name': ['Acacia longifolia'], 'introduction': '\n\nAcacia longifolia is a species of Acacia native to southeastern Australia, from the extreme southeast of Queensland, eastern New South Wales, eastern and southern Victoria, southeastern South Australia, and Tasmania. Common names for it include long-leaved wattle, acacia trinervis, aroma doble, golden wattle, coast wattle, sallow wattle and Sydney golden wattle. It is not listed as being a threatened species, and is considered invasive in Portugal, New Zealand and South Africa. In the southern region of Western Australia, it has become naturalised and has been classed as a weed by out-competing indigenous species. It is a tree that grows very quickly reaching 7–10\xa0m in five to six years.', 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'conservation_status': 'Least Concern', 'sections': "Golden wattle occurs as both a shrub or tree that can reach a height of up to 8\xa0m (26\xa0ft). It has smooth to finely fissured greyish coloured bark and glabrous branchlets that are angled towards the apices. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen and glabrous phyllodes are mostly straight but occasionally slightly curved with a length of 4 to 20\xa0cm (1.6 to 7.9\xa0in) and a width of 4 to 30\xa0mm (0.16 to 1.18\xa0in) and have numerous prominent longitudinal veins. It blooms between June and October in its native range producing simple inflorescences that occur singly or in pairs in the phyllode axils on stalks with a length of less than 2\xa0mm (0.079\xa0in). The cylindrical flower-spikes have a length of 2 to 4.5\xa0cm (0.79 to 1.77\xa0in) packed with bright to pale yellow coloured flowers. Following flowering thinly leathery to firmly papery seed pods form that are straight to strongly twisted and raised over and constricted between each of the seeds. The pods are usually 4 to 15\xa0cm (1.6 to 5.9\xa0in) in length and 2.5 to 6\xa0mm (0.098 to 0.236\xa0in) and reasonably brittle when dry.\n\nThe species was first formally described by Henry Cranke Andrews in 1802 as Mimosa longifolia in The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants then in 1806 as Acacia longifolia in the Carl Ludwig Willdenow publication Species Plantarum. It was reclassified as Racosperma longifolium in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. Other synonyms include Mimosa macrostachya and Phyllodoce longifolia.\n\nThe specific epithet refers to the long phyllodes on this species.\n\nThere are two recognised subspecies:\n\nThe species is endemic to coastal area of south eastern Queensland close to the border with New South Wales extending southward down the coast of New South Wales. In New South Wales it is common along the tablelands and coastal areas where it is situated in various habitats including foredunes and is usually a part of sclerophyll  woodland or coastal heath and scrub communities. The range then extends south and east through Victoria and into South Australia. In South Australia it is found on the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, southern Lofty Ranges and throughout the south eastern region where it is mostly restricted to sand dunes. Subspecies sophorae grows in sand dunes around the Tasmanian coastline.\n\nIt has become naturalised in the south west of Western Australia in coastal areas extending from around Perth in the north down to around Albany in the south. It is thought to have introduced by escaping from gardens and being used in restoration plantings. Control methods include hand pulling seedlings and ringbarking or using glyphosate on older plants.\n\nAcacia longifolia is widely cultivated in subtropical regions of the world. Its uses include prevention of soil erosion, food (flowers, seeds and seed pods), yellow dye (from the flowers), green dye (pods) and wood. The flower colour derives from the organic compound kaempferol. The tree's bark has limited use in tanning, primarily for sheepskin. It is useful for securing uninhabited sand in coastal areas, primarily where there are not too many hard frosts. In Tasmania the ripening pods were roasted and the seeds removed and eaten.\n\nThe shrub is available commercially and can be propagated by seed scarification or boiling water treatment.\nIt is regarded as an attractive, hardy, fast-growing species suitable as a hedge plant or for screening. Suitable for hydroseeding work on banks where it will provide soil stabilization. Sydney golden wattle is well suited for low maintenance areas such as road batters, will grow in a range of soil types and is frost hardy. It is heavily used at present in Southern California as a street canopy tree, as it grows fairly quickly (reaching a height of five meters within a year or two of planting), tolerates drought, and is resilient even to the particularly brutal pruning practices associated with low-cost tree services.\n\nIn Portugal the species is considered highly invasive in sand dunes and its cultivation is prohibited by law.\n\nIn South Africa at least, the Pteromalid wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae has been introduced from Australia, and has spread rapidly, achieving substantial control. The effect on the trees has been described as drastic seed reduction (typically over 90%) by galling of reproductive buds, and indirect debilitation of the affected plant by increased abscission of inflorescences adjacent to the growing galls. The presence of galls also caused leaf abscission, reducing vegetative growth as well as reproductive output.", 'score': 7.8535776}, {'id': 'Labrus_viridis', 'name': ['Labrus viridis'], 'introduction': '\n\nLabrus viridis (the green wrasse) is a species of wrasse native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Portugal to Morocco, as well as through the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea.  This species is found around rocky reefs amongst the rocks or in eelgrass beds.  It can reach 47\xa0cm (19\xa0in) in standard length, though most do not exceed 37.5\xa0cm (15\xa0in).  It is one of several species called green wrasse.', 'sections': 'The green wrasse grows to about 35\xa0cm (14\xa0in) and is a plump fish with a moderately large head. The eyes are large and the nostrils each have a double opening. The lips are thick and the mouth fairly small, with numerous large teeth. The back is slightly humped, and the belly is slightly convex. The skin is covered with large scales and is smooth and soft, being covered with mucus. The dorsal fin has 18 spines and 12 soft rays. The pectoral fins are large and the caudal fin undivided. In most individuals the colour is bright green with a blue line running along the flank, but some individuals are almost entirely black while others are spotted.\n\nThe green wrasse is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean between Portugal and Morocco, and most of the Mediterranean Sea, although it seems to be absent from the waters of Syria, Lebanon and Israel. It is also present in the western Black Sea. Its depth range is down to about 50\xa0m (160\xa0ft). Its typical habitat is in the vicinity of rocky reefs, especially those well-covered with seaweed, and seagrass meadows.\n\nThe green wrasse can occur in small groups but is more often found singly or in pairs. It feeds on small fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates. It is probably a protogynous hermaphrodite, that is it starts life as a female but at some stage changes its sex to male. This means that male fish are normally larger than females. A breeding pair of fish will prepare a dish-shaped nest among vegetation, and the adhesive eggs laid by the female are guarded and cared for by the male. The age of attaining maturity is probably three years, and the fish may live for twenty years.\n\nThis fish is generally uncommon. It is caught for food, including spearfishing for sport,  and the total population is in decline, especially in the western Mediterranean, with fishing being a threat in all parts of its range.

Its range includes Liguria in the extreme northwest of Italy, southern France, Spain and Portugal. It seems to be absent from eastern Spain and there is an isolated populations near Bordeaux in southwestern France. It occurs at elevations of up to 1,800\xa0m (5,906\xa0ft) above sea level. Its typical habitat is damp but sunny areas with dense low vegetation such as meadows, stream verges, marshes, grassy slopes and hedges. In the western part of its range, near the Atlantic Ocean, it may inhabit drier heathland with low scrub and gorse.\n\nThe western three-toed skink can move only slowly using its tiny limbs but can also progress at a much greater speed by undulating its body from side to side in a snake-like fashion. It hibernates deep underground in the winter and emerges late in the spring. It is very secretive and when disturbed hides in dense vegetation, under stones or in pre-existing burrows. It feeds on a wide range of invertebrate prey.\n\nMales gather during the breeding season and may fight or eat others. After a gestation period of two to three months, the female produces up to fifteen live young, each about 10\xa0cm (4\xa0in) at birth. The female sometimes dies during this process. The young attain maturity at age three or four.\n\nThe IUCN has listed the western three-toed skink as being of "Least Concern" because of its wide range and the fact that it is very common in some parts of its range.
