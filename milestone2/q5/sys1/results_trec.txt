This genus is composed of whip snakes, characterized by their large eyes and whip-like tail. The Demansia genus is commonly found in the Southern hemisphere around Australia and equatorial countries such as Papua New Guinea.[citation needed]\n\nThere are currently 14 species that have been identified under the genus Demansia, these include:\n\nDemansia psammophis is a long thin snake with a narrow head. D. psammophis grows up to a total of 1m in length, averaging around 80cm in length, females being slightly smaller than males. Characterized by their narrow yellowish head, pale ring around the eyes, and a dark marking curving along the upper lip, D. psammophis becomes distinguishable from other Demansia snakes. Juveniles can be distinguished as a white-edged dark line is seen across the snout. The large prominent eyes surrounded by a pale ring, account for its ability to be a successful diurnal species, having the largest eyes of any Australian snake assisting in prey capture. The colour of yellow-faced whip snakes varies, ranging from olive green, grey and brown; however, a common characteristic in colour is a ‘red flush along the anterior third of its back'.\n\nTo accurately identify this species, there must be a clear view of the head, and the scales around the snake's mid-body must be counted. D. psammophis has 15 midbody scale rows and between 165-230 ventrals, with the anal and subcaudals divided.\nDemansia psammophis is commonly confused with the eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis), due to their similar appearance.\n\nDemansia psammophis are distributed throughout the Australian continent, with presence in every state except Tasmania. Although the distribution of D. psammophis is wide, it is endemic to Australia.\nFound in a variety of habitats across Australia, Demansia psammophis ranges from coastal forests to arid scrublands and grasslands in Australia’s interior. \nIt is not uncommon to find more than one D. psammophis as they are community dwellers. Habitats in rock crevices and under logs are common community habitats with communities often aggregating in winter months.\n\nDemansia psammophis are diurnal reptiles, fast-moving with a nervous disposition, always alert and fleeing quickly when disturbed. The yellow-faced whip snake is subject to brumation, or slowing down their movements, in the winter months, usually only moving to seek sun and water.\n\nDemansia psammophis are oviparous, laying clutches of 5-6 and 15-20 amniotic eggs. Communal egg laying is also common among the species, with some nests having between 500-600 eggs present. D. psammophis females experience vitellogenesis between September and November, ovulating in late spring or summer. Hatchlings are approximately 17cm in length from snout to base of tail and are laid between February and March.\n\nSmall diurnal lizards are the main source of food, as well as lizard eggs. D. psammophis, although diurnal, forage during the night, catching nocturnal forms such as geckoes, lerista and frogs.\n\nSmall reptiles such as lizards and skinks are predated on by D. psammophis, during the day. Juvenile D. psammophis have been observed to constrict their prey, however, as they become adults, constriction becomes uncommon, with the species occasionally creating a single body loop to restrain their prey. To immobilize and kill prey, D. psammophis lash out and inject toxic venom, slowing and eventually killing their prey.\n\nAlthough this venom is deadly to other reptiles and amphibians, it is not considered dangerous to adults. If bitten, the bite will be painful and the injection of venom will cause localized pain and swelling, ranging from moderate to severe, with some bites causing systemic symptoms such as paralysis and bleeding. Medical treatment should be sought following any snake bite.\n\nYellow-faced whip snakes are currently classified as least concern under the IUCN Red List and are considered stable.\n\nThe species is secure under the status of least concern in the majority of States and Territories in Australia, including QLD and the NT; however, they are considered near-threatened in Victoria.\n\nD. psammophis is not found in Tasmania due to the Tasman Strait that separates it from mainland Australia and the climatic conditions of Tasmania.\n\nISBN\xa00-646-00006-3.

He bagged the snake and sent it, along with others captured from the trip, to the Western Australian Museum in Perth for closer inspection.\n\nTwo weeks later, the new species was studied. At first, it was tentatively identified as a western brown snake because of the similar size and colouring; several weeks later, however, Western Australia Museum reptile collection manager Brad Maryan noticed the now-preserved snake had a large, pale head similar to the coastal taipan.\n\nThe holotype, nicknamed "Scully" after the X-Files TV character, is an immature snake about 1 m long, which means that scientists do not know the true adult size of the species, though some taipans can reach a total length of about 3 m (about 10\xa0ft).

One in 1975 gives statistics and charts that clearly shows the differing cnidomes of U.S. species compared to that of the neotype of Gershwin\'s. No new taxa have been erected to accommodate the research.\n\nChiropsalmus quadrumanus is a cube-shaped, colourless, transparent jellyfish with a diameter of about 14 centimetres (5.5\xa0in) and height a little less than this. The body is composed of a gelatinous material and the top edges are rounded while the top surface is flat. Bundles of 7 to 9 tentacles dangle from pedalia, palmate appendages at the four lower corners of the bell, with a tentacle on each "finger". The outer two tentacles are pinkish and the inner ones yellowish white and they can be up to 3 to 4 metres (9.8 to 13.1\xa0ft) long. Halfway up the inside of the bell is the velarium, a horizontal ring of tissue partially blocking the aperture. The manubrium is a central column hanging down inside the bell with the mouth at its tip. The rounded stomach  has four pouches connecting to radial sinuses along the edges of the bell. The gonads are on either side of the radial canals.\n\nChiropsalmus quadrumanus is found on the east coast of North America in North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and a disjunct population in Brazil. It also occurs in the Pacific Ocean and has been reported from Hawaii and Australia. It is usually found in the warm, open seas but it is sometimes found inshore in large numbers in places where it has not been previously found. When this happened on the Texas Gulf coast in 1955 and 1956, it coincided with drought conditions and an associated high salinity level in the area. The jellyfish were seldom seen near the surface but small specimens were frequently taken in shrimp trawls. After gales large quantities were washed up on the beach, and after heavy rains, many dead jellyfish were found floating on the surface. When conditions returned to normal, the jellyfish disappeared.\n\nThe long tentacles of Chiropsalmus quadrumanus are armed with nematocysts, the purpose of which is to capture prey such as small fish and to deter predators. They can inflict an extremely painful sting on people that encounter them. There is a documented case of a four-year-old boy in the Gulf of Mexico dying within forty minutes of being stung. Of forty-nine people stung by jellyfish off the coast of Brazil over a five-year period, twenty were by identifiable species. Sixteen of these were identified as being caused by Chiropsalmus quadrumanus and four by the Portuguese man o\' war (Physalia physalis). All these stings were linear in nature, causing both intense pain and systemic symptoms. Apart from pain, the symptoms include cardiac dysfunction and respiratory depression. The rash lasts for several months. Antivenom administered within a few hours relieves the pain somewhat, reduces the severity of the rash, and improves other symptoms.

The sting site has minimal local reaction and does not take effect right away and becomes worse as time goes on. Scientists have just recently figured out how the venom of the Malo maxima affects the heart. The venom causes a concentration-dependent inotropic responses in the left atria of the heart, however it has no effect on the right atria. It appears that the venom does not activate the parasympathetic nervous system, but the sympathetic nervous system. The venom also stimulates the sensory nerve CGRP to release in only the left atria and the resistance arteries. The most effective therapy for Irukandji syndrome seems to be an intravenous infusion of magnesium.\n\nAustralia experiences extreme jellyfish blooms, specifically Irukandji Jellyfish blooms. The Irukandji Jellyfish blooms include Malo maxima as well as the other types of Irukandji. Human activity such as catching fish and pollution are making them a more common occurrence.

The most distinguishing characteristic is the head that can be rather small and indistinct from the neck. A dugite\'s body is long and slender in build and can grow up to 2\xa0m (6\xa0ft 7\xa0in) in total length (including tail), but the typical size is roughly 1.5\xa0m (4\xa0ft 11\xa0in).\n\nP. affinis is found in southern parts of Western Australia and in remote coastal parts of western South Australia.\n\nThe dugite occupies a wide variety of habitats ranging from coastal dunes and heathlands to shrub lands and woodlands. It also appears to thrive in heavily degraded habitats such as golf courses, industrial areas, and open agricultural farmlands.\n\nThe dugite has increased in population since the opening up of its natural habitats and introduction of the house mouse due to the mouse being a main food source for it. In the Perth metropolitan area, the dugite is one of the most common snakes found next to buildings. In areas of human population, the snake will take temporary shelter under concrete slabs, fibro sheeting, roofing tin, and such, although in more natural habitats, it will shelter under rocks and in abandoned termite mounds. It also burrows during the winter.\n\nIn the wild, dugites may be sheltering beneath logs or rocks. When disturbed, they are very shy and often slither away, but they will defend themselves if cornered. The species is diurnal. On hot days, activity occurs mainly in the morning, and to a lesser extent in the afternoon.\n\nLike most snakes, P. affinis is carnivorous, eating lizards, other snakes, mice and rats.\n\nAs with all brown snakes, mating normally occurs between early September and late November. The dugite is an egg-laying (oviparous) snake, and typically deposits around 30 eggs and abandons them to self-incubate.  The eggs hatch after about 65 days.  Under optimal environmental conditions, the dugite has been known to lay two clutches during the same season.\n\nThe venom of P. affinis is potentially one of the most lethal in the world, causing coagulopathic and procoagulant effects. Dugites generally avoid biting humans, but risks of encounters increase when they are most active during the mating season through October and November.\n\nThe last human death attributed to a dugite was in Fremantle (South Beach), on 15 August 2015, when a woman was bitten on her heel mid-afternoon while walking alone. She walked home and later collapsed whilst her husband was taking her to her car  to transport her to the hospital. The ambulance was called, arriving 5 minutes later, but medics were unable to revive her.\n\nIn January 2011, a seven-year-old Perth boy was bitten and temporarily paralyzed after a dugite entered his bedroom and wrapped itself around his arm while he slept. After receiving immediate medical attention, he made a full recovery.\n\nIn December 2020, a three-year-old girl was bitten by a snake, believed to be a dugite, while playing in a courtyard at her grandmother\'s unit complex in Mandurah. Her grandmother quickly immobilised her and wrapped her legs in pressure bandages. The girl was treated with anti-venom in hospital and made a full recovery.\n\nThe species was first described by Albert Günther in 1872.

In both sexes, the carapace and legs are dark brown to black, and the abdomen is charcoal grey with a dorsal pattern of light markings (sometimes indistinct) and a dense covering of fine, velvety hair. B. longinqua is slightly smaller (14 mm) with a greyish carapace and black-brown legs.\n\nThe web of B. insignis is a messy-looking construct of irregular sail-like shapes. There is a funnel-shaped, silken retreat, usually in the middle or corner of the web, where the spider spends most of its time waiting for prey.  The female spider never leaves the web unless forced to. They seem quite attached to their location, rarely changing the position of their webs and because of this, old webs can be quite messy, often with small objects or dust stuck in them. At night the spider comes out to repair and add to the web, often just adding new silk over the old. Males, when ready to mate, go in search of females. The male plucks the web of the female to attract her attention. Once the male has made sure that the female will be receptive, he will approach and inseminate her with his palps. They may then stay together for several days and may mate again several times.\n\nThe female constructs several white silk egg sacs, which are secured within the web retreat.

Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Ten genera and 39 species are currently recognized. Being naturally non-venomous, pythons must constrict their prey to induce cardiac arrest prior to consumption. Pythons will typically strike at and bite their prey of choice to gain hold of it; they then must use physical strength to constrict their prey, by coiling their muscular bodies around the animal, effectively suffocating it before swallowing whole. This is in stark contrast to venomous snakes such as the rattlesnake, for example, which delivers a swift, venomous bite but releases, waiting as the prey succumbs to envenomation before being consumed.  Collectively, the pythons are well-documented and studied as constrictors, much like other non-venomous snakes, including the boas and even kingsnakes of the New World.\n\nPythons are found in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia, with invasive populations of Burmese pythons in Everglades National Park, Florida and reticulated pythons in Puerto Rico. They are ambush predators that primarily kill prey by constriction, causing cardiac arrest. Pythons are oviparous, laying eggs that females incubate until they hatch. They possess premaxillary teeth, with the exception of adults in the Australian genus Aspidites. While many species are available in the exotic pet trade, caution is needed with larger species due to potential danger. The taxonomy of pythons has evolved, and they are now more closely related to sunbeam snakes and the Mexican burrowing python.\n\nPythons are poached for their meat and skin, leading to a billion-dollar global trade. They can carry diseases, such as salmonella and leptospirosis, which can be transmitted to humans. Pythons are also used in African traditional medicine to treat ailments like rheumatism and mental illnesses. Their body parts, including blood and organs, are believed to have various healing properties. In some African cultures, pythons have significant roles in folklore and mythology, often symbolizing strength or having sacred status.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['Pythons are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia, southeastern Pakistan, southern China, the Philippines and Australia.\n\nTwo known populations of invasive pythons exist in the Western Hemisphere. In the United States, an introduced population of Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) has existed as an invasive species in Everglades National Park since the late 1990s. As of January 2023, estimates place the Floridian Burmese python population at around half a million. Local bounties are awarded and scientists study dead Burmese pythons to better understand breeding cycles and trends associated with rapid population explosion. The pythons readily prey on native North American fauna in Florida, including (but not limited to) American alligators, birds, bobcats, American bullfrogs, opossums, raccoons, river otters, white-tailed deer, and occasionally domestic pets and livestock. They are also known to prey on other invasive and introduced animals to Florida, such as the green iguana and nutria (coypu), though not at a rate as to lower their numbers rapidly or effectively.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, a population of reticulated pythons (Malayopython reticulatus) are known to be currently established, with a remarkably high rate of albinism, suggesting establishment from domesticated pet stock. Records of reticulated pythons date back to as early as 2009, and the population was recognized as established by 2017. \n\nMany species have been hunted aggressively, which has greatly reduced the population of some, such as the Indian python (Python molurus) and the Ball python (Python regius).[citation needed]\n\nMost members of this family are ambush predators, in that they typically remain motionless in a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey. Attacks on humans, although known to occur, are extremely rare.\n\nPythons use their sharp, backward-curving teeth, four rows in the upper jaw, two in the lower, to grasp prey which is then killed by constriction; after an animal has been grasped to restrain it, the python quickly wraps a number of coils around it. Death occurs primarily by cardiac arrest. Even the larger species, such as the reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), do not crush their prey to death.\n\nLarger specimens usually eat animals about the size of a domestic cat, but larger food items are known; some large Asian species have been known to take down adult deer, and the Central African rock python (Python sebae) has been known to eat antelope. The reticulated python is the only python species known to sometimes eat humans in its natural habitat in Sulawesi, Indonesia. All prey is swallowed whole, and may take several days or even weeks to fully digest.\n\nPythons are oviparous. This sets them apart from the family Boidae (boas), most of which bear live young (ovoviviparous). After they lay their eggs, females typically incubate them until they hatch. This is achieved by causing the muscles to "shiver", which raises the temperature of the body to a certain degree, and thus that of the eggs. Keeping the eggs at a constant temperature is essential for healthy embryo development. During the incubation period, females do not eat and leave only to bask to raise their body temperature.\n\nMost species in this family are available in the exotic pet trade. However, caution must be exercised with the larger species, as they can be dangerous; rare cases of large specimens killing their owners have been documented.\n\nObsolete classification schemes—such as that of Boulenger (1890)—place pythons in Pythoninae, a subfamily of the boa family, Boidae. However, despite a superficial K-means clustering resemblance to boas, pythons are more closely related to the sunbeam snakes (Xenopeltis) and the Mexican burrowing python (Loxocemus).\n\nPoaching of pythons is a lucrative business with the global python skin trade being an estimated US$1 billion as of 2012. Pythons are poached for their meat, mostly consumed locally as bushmeat and their skin, which is sent to Europe and North America for manufacture of accessories like bags, belts and shoes. The demand for poaching is increased because python farming is very expensive.\n\nIn Cameroon bushmeat markets, the Central African rock python is commonly sold for meat and is very expensive at US$175. The poaching of the pythons is illegal in Cameroon under their wildlife law, but there is little to no enforcement. In Kenya, there has been an increase in snake farms to address the demand for snakeskin internationally, but there are health concerns for the workers, and danger due to poachers coming to the farms to hunt the snakes.\n\nWhile pythons are not venomous, they do carry a host of potential health issues for humans. Pythons are disease vectors for multiple illnesses, including Salmonella, Chlamydia, Leptospirosis, Aeromoniasis, Campylobacteriosis, and Zygomycosis. These diseases may be transmitted to humans through excreted waste, open wounds, and contaminated water. A 2013 study found that Reptile-Associated Salmonella (RAS) is most common in young children who had been in contact with invasive pythons, with symptoms including "sepsis, meningitis, and bone and joint infection".\n\nPythons are also integrated into some aspects of African health and belief use, often with the added risk of contacting zoonotic diseases. Python bodies and blood are used for African traditional medicines and other belief uses as well, one in-depth study of all animals used by the Yorubas of Nigeria for traditional medicine found that the African Python is used to cure rheumatism, snake poison, appeasing witches, and accident prevention.\n\nPython habitats, diets, and invasion into new areas also impact human health and prosperity. A University of Florida Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences study found that the Burmese python, as an invasive species, enters new habitats and eats an increasing number of mammals, leaving limited species for mosquitoes to bite, forcing them to bite disease-carrying hispid cotton rats and then infect humans with the Everglades virus, a dangerous infection that is carried by very few animals. While direct human-python interactions can be potentially dangerous, the risk of zoonotic diseases is always a concern, whether considering medical and belief use in Nigeria or when addressing invasive species impacts in Florida. In 2022, a woman who lived near a lake area in south-eastern New South Wales state, Australia, was found to be infested with the Ophidascaris robertsi roundworm which is common in carpet pythons - non-venomous snakes found across much of Australia.\n\nPython skin has traditionally been used as the attire of choice for medicine men and healers. Typically, South African Zulu traditional healers will use python skin in ceremonial regalia. Pythons are viewed by the Zulu tradition to be a sign of power. This is likely why the skin is worn by traditional healers. Healers are seen as all-powerful since they have a wealth of knowledge, as well as accessibility to the ancestors.\n\nTypically, species are attributed to healing various ailments based on their likeliness to a specific bodily attribute. For example, in many cultures, the python is seen as a strong and powerful creature. As a result, pythons are often prescribed as a method of increasing strength. It is very common for the body fat of pythons to be used to treat a large variation of issues such as joint pain, rheumatic pain, toothache and eye sight. Additionally, python fat has been used to treat those suffering from mental illnesses like psychosis. Their calm nature is thought to be of use to treat combative patients. The fat of the python is rubbed onto the body part that is in pain. To improve mental illnesses, it is often rubbed on the temple. The existence of evidence for genuine anti inflammatory and anti-microbial properties of the refined \'snake oil\' ironic with respect to the expression "snake oil salesman".\n\nPython blood plays another important role in traditional medicine. Many believe that python blood prevents the accumulation of fatty acids, triglycerides and lipids from reaching critically high levels. Additionally, their blood has been used as a source of iron for people who are anemic, which helps reduce fatigue.[The sources were not specific on the way this blood is administered; however, due to the use of snake blood in traditional treatments in other parts of the world for similar causes, it is likely that the patient drinks the blood in order to feel the effects.\n\nThe Sukuma tribe of Tanzania have been known to use python feces in order to treat back pain. The feces are frequently mixed with a little water, placed on the back, and left for two to three days.\n\nIn Nigeria, the gallbladder and liver of a python are used to treat poison or bites from other snakes. The python head has been used to "appease witches". Many traditional African cultures believe that they can be cursed by witches. In order to reverse spells and bad luck, traditional doctors will prescribe python heads.\n\nIn northwestern Ghana, people see pythons as a savior and have taboos to prevent the snake from being harmed or eaten. Their folklore states that this is because a python once helped them flee from their enemies by transforming into a log to allow them to cross a river.\n\nIn Botswana, San ritual practices surrounding pythons date back 70,000 years. In San mythology the python is a sacred creature that is highly respected. They believe that mankind was made by a python that moved in between hills to create stream beds.\n\nIn Benin, Vodun practitioners believe that pythons symbolize strength and the spirit of Dagbe ["to do good" in Yoruba].\xa0Annually, people sacrifice animals and proclaim their sins to pythons that are kept inside temples.'], 'score': 5.3154936}, {'id': 'Actinopodidae', 'name': ['Actinopodidae'], 'introduction': ['\n\n3, see text\n\nActinopodidae is a family of mygalomorph spiders found in mainland Australia and South America usually in open forest.

The Wik-Mungkan people used the name in reference to an ancestral creator being in Aboriginal Australian mythology known as the Rainbow Serpent.\n\nThe genus name is from Greek ὀξῠ́ς (oxys: sharp, needle-like) and οὐρανός (ouranos: an arch, specifically the vault of the heavens), and refers to the needle-like anterior process on the arch of the palate, which Kinghorn noted separated the genus from all other elapids. The oft-quoted meaning "sharp-tailed" (based on a confusion with οὐρά, oura, "tail", and Latin anus) is both etymologically and morphologically incorrect.\n\nThe three known species are the coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus), the inland taipan (O. microlepidotus), and a recently discovered third species, the Central Ranges taipan (O. temporalis). The coastal taipan has two subspecies: the coastal taipan (O. s. scutellatus), found along the northeastern coast of Queensland, and the Papuan taipan (O. s. canni), found on the southern coast of New Guinea.\n\nA 2016 genetic analysis showed that the speckled brown snake (Pseudonaja guttata) was an early offshoot of a lineage giving rise to the taipans, with the Central Ranges taipan being an offshoot of the common ancestor of the inland and coastal taipans.\n\nTheir diet consists primarily of small mammals, especially rats and bandicoots.\n\nSpecies of this genus possess highly neurotoxic venom with some other toxic constituents that have multiple effects on victims. The venom is known to paralyse the victim\'s nervous system and clot the blood, which then blocks blood vessels and uses up clotting factors. Members of this genus are considered to be among the most venomous snakes in the world based on their murine LD50, an indicator of the toxicity on mice. The inland taipan is considered to be the most venomous snake in the world and the coastal taipan, which is arguably the largest Australian venomous snake, is the third-most venomous snake in the world. The Central Ranges taipan has been less researched than other species of this genus, so the exact toxicity of its venom is still not clear, but it may be even more venomous than the other taipan species. Apart from venom toxicity, quantities of venom delivered should also be taken into account for the danger posed. The coastal taipan is capable of injecting a large quantity of venom due to its large size.\n\nIn 1950, Kevin Budden, an amateur herpetologist, was one of the first people to capture a taipan alive, although he was bitten in the process and died the next day. The snake, which ended up dying a few weeks later, was the first known taipan to have been milked for venom: Melbourne zoologist David Fleay and Dr. F. C. Morgan performed the milking, and the venom was used to develop an antivenom, which became available in 1955. The original preserved specimen is currently stored in the facilities of Museums Victoria.\n\nTwo antivenoms are available: CSL polyvalent antivenom and CSL taipan antivenom, both from CSL Limited in Australia.\n\nIn his book Venom, which explores the development of a taipan antivenom in Australia in the 1940s and 1950s, author Brendan James Murray states that only one person is known to have survived an Oxyuranus bite without antivenom: George Rosendale, a Guugu Yimithirr person bitten at Hope Vale in 1949.

This species is sometimes placed in the genus Dasyatis or Hypolophus (an obsolete synonym of Pastinachus). The most distinctive characteristic of the cowtail stingray is the large, flag-like ventral fold on its tail, which is especially prominent when the ray is swimming. This species is targeted by commercial fisheries as a source of high-quality shagreen, a type of leather, and its populations are now under threat from heavy exploitation.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The cowtail stingray has a widespread distribution in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, from South Africa and the Red Sea to Japan and Australia, including Melanesia and Micronesia. They are amphidromous and known to enter estuaries and rivers. This species is the most commonly reported stingray from fresh water in Southeast Asia, and there is a record from the Ganges River some 2,200\xa0km (1,400\xa0mi) from the sea. They are usually found on sandy bottoms in coastal waters and on coral reefs to a depth of 60 meters (200 feet).\n\nThe pectoral fin disk of the cowtail stingray is very thick, with almost straight anterior margins and rounded apices, and measuring 1.1-1.3 times as long as wide. The snout is broadly rounded and blunt. The eyes are very small and widely spaced. The mouth is narrow, with 20 rows of distinctive hexagonal, high-crowned teeth in each jaw and five papillae on the mouth floor. The tail is broad-based, with a filamentous tip and a single venomous spine located well backwards of the pelvic fins. There is no upper tail fold; the high ventral tail fold measures 2-3 times the height of the tail but does not reach the tip.\n\nThe disk surface is covered by a broad band of fine dermal denticles extending from near the tip of the snout to the upper surface of the tail, excluding the extreme margins of the disk. Newborns are entirely smooth but develop denticles quickly after birth. Juveniles have four circular tubercles at the center of the disk, which often become indistinct in adults. The coloration is a uniform grayish brown to black above and mostly white below. The tail fold and tip are black. This species may reach 3 meters (9.8 feet) long and 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) across, and 250\xa0kg (550\xa0lb) in weight.\n\nCowtail stingrays are solitary foragers that feed on bony fishes (including leiognathids, Nemipterus, and soles), crustaceans, polychaete worms, sipunculids, and molluscs. The cowtail stingray is in turn preyed upon by various species of hammerhead and requiem sharks, as well as by the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus). When threatened, they consistently flee at a 45° angle away from the predator, a trajectory that allows them to maximize the distance covered while still keeping the predator within their field of vision.\n\nLike other stingrays, reproduction in this species is ovoviviparous, with the embryos sustained in late development by histotroph ("uterine milk") delivered via specialized structures. The females giving birth to live young measuring 18\xa0cm (7.1\xa0in) across or more. Single young individuals have been reported year-round in the Strait of Malacca; juveniles have more pointed snouts than adults. Adults are sometimes accompanied by remoras or trevallies. Known parasites of the cowtail stingray include Dendromonocotyle ardea, Decacotyle tetrakordyle, and Pterobdella amara.\n\nObservations of cowtail stingrays in Shark Bay, Australia, show that this species enters shallow, sandy flats during high tide to rest for a minimum of four hours. They often form small groups when resting, particularly when visibility is poor such as in turbid water or under low light conditions. The typical size of such groups is three individuals (larger groups, up to nine, are rare), arranged in a "rosette" formation with their tails pointing outward. This appears to be an anti-predator behavior, as the close circular arrangement of the rays allows them to see predators approaching from any direction. The rosette also orients their less critical tails, containing mechanoreceptors that comprise a secondary warning system, towards potential threats. The members of the group will flee in concert, reducing a predator\'s ability to target any one individual. Cowtail stingrays also preferentially form mixed-species groups with reticulate whiprays (Himantura uarnak), likely because the whiprays are better able to detect predators due to their longer tails.\n\nThe serrated spine of the cowtail stingray is potentially dangerous, and this species is regarded as particularly dangerous to handle as its long tail is capable of reaching over its back to strike someone gripping it from the front. Small to moderate numbers of cowtail stingrays are caught as bycatch in trawls and marketed for meat throughout their range, and their tough skin is used to polish wood. This species is also the primary source of shagreen or galuchat, a type of leather, for which it has been valued since ancient times due to the large size and regular arrangement of its dorsal tubercles (called "pearls" in the trade from their nacreous appearance after being rubbed down, hence the old name "pearled ray").\n\nA boom in the international shagreen trade since the 1990s, with the material being used in many fashion accessories from wallets to fancy pens, has led to enormous numbers of cowtail stingrays being harvested in Southeast Asia. As stingrays are slow-reproducing, long-lived animals, there are fears that this unregulated exploitation is unsustainable and will lead to a population collapse.'], 'score': 5.054884}, {'id': 'Varanus_scalaris', 'name': ['Varanus scalaris'], 'introduction': ['\n\nVaranus scalaris is a small species of monitor lizard.

However,  on the Adelaide River floodplains, this species preys mainly on dusky rats (Rattus colletti).\n\nMating takes place in July–August, which is the middle of the dry season.

The species is endemic to semiarid regions of central east Australia. Aboriginal Australians living in those regions named the snake dandarabilla. It was formally described by Frederick McCoy in 1879 and then by William John Macleay in 1882, but for the next 90 years, it was a mystery to the scientific community; no further specimens were found, and virtually nothing was added to the knowledge of this species until its rediscovery in 1972.\n\nBased on the median lethal dose value in mice, the venom of the inland taipan is by far the most toxic of any snake – much more so than even that of sea snakes – and it has the most toxic venom of any reptile when tested on human heart cell culture. The inland taipan is a specialist hunter of mammals, so its venom is specially adapted to kill warm-blooded species. One bite possesses enough lethality to kill more than an estimated 100 fully grown humans. It is an extremely fast and agile snake that can strike instantly with extreme accuracy,  often striking multiple times in the same attack, and it envenomates in almost every case.\n\nAlthough the most venomous and a capable striker, in contrast to the coastal taipan, which many experts cite as an extremely dangerous snake due to its behaviour when it encounters humans, the inland taipan is usually quite a shy and reclusive snake, with a placid disposition, and prefers to escape from trouble. However, it will defend itself and strike if provoked, mishandled, or prevented from escaping. Because it lives in such remote locations, the inland taipan seldom comes in contact with people; therefore it is not considered the deadliest snake in the world overall, especially in terms of disposition and human deaths per year. The word "fierce" from its alternative name describes its venom, not its temperament.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['To the Aboriginal people from the place now called Goyder Lagoon in north-east South Australia, the inland taipan was called dandarabilla.\n\nThe inland taipan was first described scientifically in 1879. Two specimens of the fierce snake were discovered at the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers in northwestern Victoria and described by Frederick McCoy, who called the species Diemenia microlepidota, or small-scaled brown snake. In 1882, a third specimen was found near Bourke, New South Wales, and William John Macleay described the same snake under the name Diemenia ferox (thinking it was a different species). No more specimens were collected until 1972. In 1896, George Albert Boulenger classified both as belonging to the same genus, Pseudechis (black snakes), referring to them as Pseudechis microlepidotus and P. ferox.\n\nIn 1956, relying only on published descriptions and notes, James Roy Kinghorn regarded ferox as a synonym for microlepidotus and proposed the genus Parademansia. In 1963, Eric Worrell considered Parademansia microlepidotus and Oxyuranus scutellatus (coastal taipan, named simply "taipan" in those days) to be the same species.\n\nIn September 1972, after receiving an unclassified snake head sample from a grazier from one of the Channel Country stations west of Windorah of the far southwest Queensland, herpetologists Jeanette Covacevich (then working for the Queensland Museum) and Charles Tanner travelled to the site and found 13 living specimens, and rediscovered the lost snake Parademansia microlepidotus. In 1976, Covacevich and Wombey argued that Parademansia microlepidotus belongs to a distinct genus, and this was also the opinion of Harold Cogger.\n\nCovacevich, McDowell, Tanner & Mengden (1981) successfully argued, by comparing anatomical features, chromosomes, and behaviours of the two species then known as Oxyuranus scutellatus (taipan) and Parademansia microlepidota, that they belonged in a single genus.  Oxyuranus (1923), the more senior name, was adopted for the combined genus.\n\nOxyuranus microlepidotus has been the fierce snake\'s binomial name since the early 1980s. The generic name Oxyuranus is from Greek oxys "sharp, needle-like", and ouranos "an arch" (specifically the arch of the heavens) and refers to the needle-like anterior process on the arch of the palate. The specific name microlepidotus means "small-scaled" (Latin). Hence the common name, "small-scaled snake". Since Covacevich et al., 1981, determined that the fierce snake (formerly: Parademansia microlepidota) is actually part of the genus Oxyuranus (taipan), another species, Oxyuranus scutellatus, which was previously known simply as the "taipan" (coined from the aboriginal snake\'s name dhayban), was renamed the "coastal taipan" (or "eastern taipan"), while the now newly classified Oxyuranus microlepidotus became commonly known as the "inland taipan" (or "western taipan").\n\nThe inland taipan inhabits the black soil plains in the semiarid regions where the Queensland and South Australia borders converge.\n\nIn Queensland, the snake has been observed in Channel Country region (e.g., Diamantina National Park, Durrie Station, Morney Plains Station and Astrebla Downs National Park) and in South Australia it has been observed in the Marree-Innamincka NRM District (e.g., Goyder Lagoon Tirari Desert, Sturt Stony Desert, Coongie Lakes, Innamincka Regional Reserve and Oodnadatta).  An isolated population also occurs near Coober Pedy, South Australia.\n\nTwo old records exist for localities further south-east, i.e., the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers in northwestern Victoria (1879) and Bourke, New South Wales (1882), but the species has not been observed in either state since then.\n\nLike every Australian snake, the inland taipan is protected by law.\n\nConservation status for the snake was assessed for the IUCN Red List for the first time in July 2017, and in 2018, was designated as least concern, stating, "This species is listed as least concern, as it is widespread and overall, it is not considered to be declining. Although the impact of potential threats requires further research, these are likely to be localized within the snake\'s range."\n\nThe inland taipan\'s conservation status has also been designated by Australian official sources:\n\nInland taipans are held in several zoo collections in Australia and overseas including the Adelaide Zoo and Taronga Zoo in Sydney.\n\nThe inland taipan is also on public display in Australia at the Australia Zoo, Australian Reptile Park, Billabong Sanctuary, Cairns Tropical Zoo, Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Shoalhaven Zoo.\n\nThe snake is also on display at several locations outside of Australia. In the United States, inland taipans are held at the Reptile Gardens in South Dakota, at Kentucky Reptile Zoo and at Animal World & Snake Farm Zoo in Texas.\n\nIn Europe, inland taipans are held in Sweden at the Stockholm Skansen Zoo and Gothenburg Universeum Moscow Zoo in Russia, (in the Moscow Zoo they are kept in the House of Reptiles, which is not usually open to the general public.) and in the UK at the London Zoo. Amateur zoo listings also report the snake at the tropicarium park in Jesolo, Italy, in Gifttierhaus Eimsheim, Welt der Gifte Greifswald,  and Terra Zoo Rheinberg, Germany, in Lausanne vivarium Lausanne, Switzerland, in Randers Tropical Zoo Denmark, in Plzeň Zoo Czech Republic, and in Reptilienzoo Nockalm Patergassen Austria.\n\nIn Asia, inland taipans are held in the Singapore Zoo.\n\nIn New South Wales, private ownership of an inland taipan is legal only with the highest class of venomous reptile licence.\n\nThe inland taipan is dark tan, ranging from a rich, dark hue to a brownish light green, depending on the season. Its back, sides, and tail may be different shades of brown and grey, with many scales having a wide, blackish edge. These dark-marked scales occur in diagonal rows so that the marks align to form broken chevrons of variable length that are inclined backward and downward. The lowermost lateral scales often have an anterior yellow edge. The dorsal scales are smooth and without keels. The round-snouted head and neck are usually noticeably darker than the body (glossy black in winter; dark brown in summer), the darker colour allowing the snake to heat itself while exposing only a smaller portion of the body at the burrow entrance. The eyes are of average size with blackish-brown irises and without a noticeable coloured rim around the pupils.\n\nIt has 23 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, between 55 and 70 divided subcaudal scales, and one anal scale.\n\nThe inland taipan averages about 1.8\xa0m (5.9\xa0ft) in total length, although larger specimens can reach total lengths of 2.5\xa0m (8.2\xa0ft). Its fangs are between 3.5 and 6.2\xa0mm long (shorter than those of the coastal taipan).\n\nInland taipans adapt to their environments by changing the colour of their skin during seasonal changes. They tend to become lighter during the summer and darker during the winter. This seasonal colour change facilitates thermoregulation, allowing the snake to absorb more radiant heat in the colder months.\n\nInland taipans produce clutches of one to two dozen eggs. The eggs hatch in about two months. They are usually laid in abandoned animal burrows and deep crevices. Reproduction rate depend in part on their diet: if not enough food is available, then the snake reproduces less.\n\nCaptive snakes generally live for 10 to 15 years. An inland taipan at the Australia Zoo lived to be over 20 years old.\n\nIn the wild, the inland taipan consumes only mammals, mostly rodents, such as the long-haired rat (Rattus villosissimus), the plains rat (Pseudomys australis), the introduced house mouse (Mus musculus), and other dasyurids. In captivity, it may also eat day-old chicks. Unlike other venomous snakes that strike with a single, accurate bite then retreat while waiting for the prey to die, the fierce snake subdues the prey with a series of rapid, accurate strikes. It is known to deliver up to eight venomous bites in a single attack, often snapping its jaws fiercely several times to inflict multiple punctures in the same attack. Its more risky attack strategy entails holding its prey with its body and biting it repeatedly. This injects the extremely toxic venom deep into the prey. The venom acts so rapidly that its prey does not have time to fight back.\n\nThe mulga snake (Pseudechis australis) is immune to most Australian snake venom, and is known to also eat young inland taipans. The perentie (Varanus giganteus), a large monitor lizard, shares the same habitat. As it grows large enough, it readily tackles large venomous snakes as prey.\n\nMany reptile keepers consider it a placid snake to handle.\n\nInland taipans are rarely encountered in the wild by the average person because of their remoteness and brief above-ground appearance during the day. So long as a person is not creating much vibration and noise, the inland taipan may not feel alarmed or bothered by a human presence. However, caution should be exercised and a safe distance maintained as it can inflict a potentially fatal bite. The inland taipan will defend itself and strike if provoked, mishandled, or prevented from escaping. Firstly, but not always, it makes a threat display by raising its forebody in a tight low S-shaped curve with its head facing the threat. Should the person choose to ignore the warning, the inland taipan will strike. It is an extremely fast and agile snake that can strike instantly with extreme accuracy, and it envenoms in almost every case.\n\nClinical toxicologist, venom researcher, herpetologist, and family physician Scott A. Weinstein et al. have stated in Toxicon journal (October 2017) "There have been 11 previously well-documented envenomings by O. microlepidotus, but only 2 were inflicted by wild snakes. When clinically indicated, prompt provision of adequate antivenom is the cornerstone of managing O. microlepidotus envenoming. Rapid application of pressure-bandage immobilization and efficient retrieval of victims envenomed in remote locales, preferably by medically well-equipped aircraft, probably improves the likelihood of a positive outcome."\n\nA case of survival without antivenom was recorded in 1967; on 15 September, a tour guide was bitten while trying to capture a snake for a tour group in the Channel Country. He was conveyed to Broken Hill Hospital and then to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide, but was not given antivenom, as he reported he was severely allergic to horse serum and believed he had been bitten by a brown snake. He spent four weeks in the hospital overall; his condition was likened to severe myasthenia gravis. Meanwhile, the snake was sent to Eric Worrell, who confirmed it was a coastal taipan. After its rediscovery in 1972, it was identified as an inland taipan.\n\nIn 1984, Australian toxicologist Peter Mirtschin was bitten by a 3-week-old inland taipan. He was the first to be treated with Taipan antivenom.\n\nIn September 2012, in the small city of Kurri Kurri, New South Wales, north of Sydney, more than 1000 km away from the snake\'s natural environment, a teenaged boy was bitten on the finger by an inland taipan. The teenager\'s rapid self-application of a compression bandage above the wound and the availability and administration of a polyvalent (broad-spectrum) antivenom in the local hospital saved his life. The police worked to find out how the inland taipan got to this part of Australia. The snake was most likely a stolen or illegal pet and the boy had tried to feed it.\n\nIn December 2013, reptile handler Scott Grant (age 40+), who was conducting a demonstration in front of 300 people at the annual building union\'s picnic in Portland, Victoria, had just finished showing the crowd an inland taipan and was trying to put it into a bag when it struck him. He got into his utility and tied a bandage around his arm. A few minutes later, however, he was lying on the ground and convulsing. He was flown in a serious condition to Essendon Airport and driven to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where his condition was stabilised, and over time, he recovered. Only a tiny amount of venom from the inland taipan had entered his body, and the adverse reaction he felt shortly after was an allergic one, presumably due to his past snake bites.\n\nIn October 2017, Weinstein et al. published a case report in Toxicon, writing, "The victim was seeking to observe members of an isolated population of this species and was envenomed while attempting to photograph an approximately 1.5 m specimen. He reported feeling “drowsiness” and blurred vision that progressed to ptosis; he later developed dysphagia and dysarthria. The patient was treated with one vial of polyvalent antivenom, which was later followed by an additional two vials of taipan monovalent. He was intubated during retrieval, and recovered after 3 days of intensive care. He had a right ophthalmoplegia that persisted for approximately 1 week post-envenoming.".\n\nAccording to Rob Bredl, "the Barefoot Bushman", in an isolated area of South Australia, his father, Joe Bredl, was bitten while catching an inland taipan and barely survived. A more recent victim was his friend John Robinson, bitten while cleaning an inland taipan\'s cage at his reptile display on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. He weathered the bite without antivenom, but sustained considerable muscle damage, as well as heart damage.\n\nAlmost all positively identified inland taipan bite victims have been herpetologists handling the snakes for study or snake handlers, such as people who catch snakes to extract their venom, or keepers in wildlife parks. All were treated successfully with antivenom. No recorded incidents have been fatal since the advent of monovalent (specific) antivenom therapy, though weeks are needed to recover from such a severe bite.\n\nJeff Leibowitz, an American snake collector, was bitten by an inland taipan in 2024. Leibowitz was hospitalized and given anti-venom, and survived.\n\nThe average quantity of venom delivered by this species is 44\xa0mg, and the maximum dose recorded is 110\xa0mg, compared to the Indian cobra (Naja naja) 169\xa0mg/max 610\xa0mg, and the North American eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) 410\xa0mg/max 848\xa0mg.\n\nThe median lethal dose (LD50), subcutaneous (the most applicable to actual bites) for mice is 0.025\xa0mg/kg (0.01\xa0mg/kg subcutaneous, in bovine serum albumin). Compared to the beaked sea snake (Enhydrina schistosa) 0.164\xa0mg/kg, Indian cobra 0.565\xa0mg/kg, North American eastern diamondback rattlesnake 11.4\xa0mg/kg, the inland taipan has a smaller venom yield than its cousin the coastal taipan yet its venom is almost four times as toxic. One bite\'s worth of venom is enough to kill 100 fully grown men.\n\nIntravenous, intraperitoneal, and intramuscular LD50s for the inland taipan venom have not been tested.\n\nBelcher\'s sea snake (Hydrophis belcheri), which many times is mistakenly called the hook-nosed sea snake (Enhydrina schistosa), has been erroneously popularized as the most venomous snake in the world, due to Ernst and Zug\'s published book Snakes in Question: The Smithsonian Answer Book from 1996. Bryan Grieg Fry, a prominent venom expert, has clarified the error: "The hook-nosed myth was due to a fundamental error in a book called Snakes in Question. In there, all the toxicity testing results were lumped in together, regardless of the mode of testing (e.g. subcutaneous vs. intramuscular vs. intravenous vs. intraperitoneal). As the mode can influence the relative number, venoms can only be compared within a mode. Otherwise, it\'s apples and rocks." Belcher\'s sea snake\'s actual LD50 (recorded only intramuscularly) is 0.24\xa0mg/kg and 0.155\xa0mg/kg, less lethal than other sea snakes such as the olive sea snake (Aipysurus laevis) 0.09\xa0mg/kg and the most toxic intramuscularly,  recorded of the sea snakes – the black-banded robust sea snake (Hydrophis melanosoma) 0.082\xa0mg/kg. The black-banded robust sea snake has also been tested subcutaneously registering at 0.111\xa0mg/kg, which is in line with the coastal taipan and thus more than four times less toxic than the inland taipan\'s venom. In the LD50 subcutaneous test, it is actually Dubois\' sea snake (Aipysurus duboisii) which has the most toxic venom of any of the sea snakes tested, registering at 0.044\xa0mg/kg. This is still nearly half as lethal as the inland taipan\'s venom.\n\nThe biological properties and toxicity of a baby inland taipan\'s venom are not significantly different from or weaker than those of an adult\'s.\n\nThe inland taipan\'s venom consists of:\n\nParadoxin (PDX) appears to be one of the most potent, if not the most potent, beta-neurotoxins yet discovered. Beta-neurotoxins keep nerve endings from liberating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n\nAccording to researcher Ronelle Welton of James Cook University, most of the contents in the venom have not been characterized and little molecular research has been undertaken on taipan (Oxyuranus) species at large. As of 2005, the amino acid sequences of only seven proteins from inland taipan have been submitted to SWISS-PROT databases.\n\nThe mortality rate is high in untreated cases:\n\nClinically, envenomation may represent a complex scenario of multiple organ-system poisoning, with neurotoxic symptoms typically dominating. Acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated coagulopathy may also complicate the setting.\n\nThe first local and general symptoms of a bite are local pain and variable nonspecific effects, which may include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dizziness, collapse, or convulsions leading to major organ effects - neurotoxicity, coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis or kidney failure/damage, and finally death.\n\nInland taipan snake venom contains potent presynaptic neurotoxins (toxins in venom that cause paralysis or muscle weakness). Also present are postsynaptic neurotoxins, which are less potent, but more rapidly acting than the presynaptic neurotoxins. Presynaptic neurotoxins disrupt neurotransmitter release from the axon terminal. This takes days to resolve and does not respond to antivenom. Postsynaptic neurotoxins competitively block acetylcholine receptors, but the effect can be reversed by antivenom. Envenoming causes a progressive descending flaccid paralysis; ptosis is usually the first sign, then facial (dysarthria) and bulbar involvement occur, progressing to dyspnea and respiratory paralysis leading to suffocation and peripheral weakness. Because it can act so fast, it can kill a person within about 45 minutes. People experiencing effects of the venom within half an hour have been reported. The development of general or respiratory paralysis is of paramount concern in that these are often difficult to reverse once established, even with large amounts of antivenom. Prolonged intubation and ventilatory support (perhaps up to a week or longer) may be required. Early diagnosis of neurotoxic symptoms and prompt and adequate dosages of antivenom are critical to avoid these complications.\n\nThe venom also contains a potent hemotoxin (procoagulants), a prothrombin activator that leads to the consumption of major coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, leading to interference with blood clotting. This causes defibrination, with nonclottable blood, putting victims at risk of major bleeding from the bite site and can lead to more serious, sometimes fatal, internal haemorrhaging, especially in the brain. Recovering from this takes many hours after venom neutralisation has been achieved with antivenom. Taipan snake procoagulants are among the most powerful snake venom procoagulants known, though mild coagulopathy has also been reported for inland taipan envenomation (Sutherland and Tibballs, 2001).\n\nNo nephrotoxins (kidney toxins) have so far been isolated from inland taipan snake venoms, but renal (kidney) impairment or acute kidney failure can occur secondary to severe rhabdomyolysis.\n\nTaipan snake venom does contain myotoxins that cause myolysis (rhabdomyolysis, muscle damage); the urine of bite victims often turns reddish-brown as their muscles release myoglobin, which is passed through the kidneys (myoglobinuria). The kidneys are often badly damaged by filtering so much tissue debris out of the blood, and kidney failure is a common complication in serious cases of significant envenoming.\n\nCauses of death:\n\nUntil 1955, the only antivenom available for general distribution for Australian snakes was the monovalent (specific) tiger snake (Notechis) antivenom, which gave varying degrees of cross-protection against the bites of most other dangerous Australian snakes. Thereafter followed specific antivenom for other common snakes, among them the coastal taipan, and finally, a polyvalent (broad-spectrum) antivenom for the bites of any unidentified snake from Australia.\n\nThe coastal taipan antivenom, known as "taipan antivenom", is effective against the inland taipan venom, as well, but it is not as effective in bite victims of the inland taipan as in those of the coastal taipan.\n\nTaipan antivenom is produced and manufactured by the Australian Reptile Park and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne.'], 'score': 4.5815096}, {'id': 'Parasuta_spectabilis', 'name': ['Parasuta spectabilis'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe spectacled hooded snake (Suta spectabilis), also known commonly as the Port Lincoln snake, is a species of venomous snake in the family Elapidae.

The king brown snake is the largest terrestrial venomous snake in Australia. Despite its common name, it is a member of the genus Pseudechis (black snakes) and only distantly related to true brown snakes. Its alternative common name is the mulga snake, although it lives in many habitats apart from mulga. First described by English zoologist John Edward Gray in 1842, it is a robust snake up to 3.3\xa0m (11\xa0ft) long. It is variable in appearance, with individuals from northern Australia having tan upper parts, while those from southern Australia are dark brown to blackish. Sometimes, it is seen in a reddish-green texture. The dorsal scales are two-toned, sometimes giving the snake a patterned appearance. Its underside is cream or white, often with orange splotches. The species is oviparous. The snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, though may have declined with the spread of the cane toad.\n\nIts venom is not as potent as those of Australia's other dangerous snakes, but can still cause severe effects if delivered in large enough quantities. Its main effect is on striated muscle tissue, causing paralysis from muscle damage, and also commonly affects blood clotting (coagulopathy). Often, extensive pain and swelling occur, rarely with necrosis, at the bite site. Deaths from its bites have been recorded, with the most recent being in 1969. Its victims are treated with black snake (not brown snake) antivenom."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The species was first described by English zoologist John Edward Gray in 1842 from a specimen collected at Port Essington in the Northern Territory. Gray saw little distinction from the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje) in his single preserved specimen—excepting the variation in ocular plates—and assigned the name Naja australis. On obtaining a second specimen from the College of Surgeons, Albert Günther of the British Museum recognised an affinity with the Australian species described as Pseudechis porphyriacus, resulting in the current combination as Pseudechis australis in the black snake genus Pseudechis. Scottish-Australian naturalist William Macleay described Pseudechis darwiniensis in 1878, from a more slender specimen that he thought was distinct from P. australis. Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger described P. cupreus in 1896 from a specimen collected from the Murray River, distinguishing P. darwiniensis from P. australis by the shape of the frontal scale. Austrian zoologist Franz Werner described Pseudechis denisonioides from Eradu, Western Australia in 1909. Australian naturalist Donald Thomson obtained a skull of a large specimen with a wide head collected from East Alligator River in Arnhem Land in 1914, naming it Pseudechis platycephalus in 1933. He distinguished it from P. australis on the basis of it having anteriorly grooved palatine and pterygoid teeth, and having blunt ridges and keels on the dorsal scales.\n\nIn 1955, Australian herpetologist Roy Mackay concluded that several species previously described were synonymous with P. australis, recognising that it was a highly variable taxon. He noted that P. australis had frontal scales of variable shape, and that grooves were present on the teeth of many specimens of Pseudechis, so these features did not support separate species. Australian herpetologists Richard W. Wells and C. Ross Wellington described Cannia centralis in 1985 from a 1.3\xa0m (4\xa0ft 3\xa0in) specimen collected 8\xa0km (5\xa0mi) north of Tennant Creek in 1977, distinguishing it on the basis of a narrow head; however, the distinction was not supported by other authors. Two new species and a new genus have been described within this complex by Australian snake-handler Raymond Hoser—the eastern dwarf mulga snake (P. pailsei) from near Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia, and the Papuan pygmy mulga snake (P. rossignolii), found in Irian Jaya. Hoser later also resurrected the pygmy mulga snake (P. weigeli, originally described as Cannia weigeli by Wells and Wellington in 1987). These descriptions were initially received with skepticism due to the low level of evidence provided in the original descriptions.\n\nThe species was long regarded as monotypic and highly variable until German biologist Ulrich Kuch and colleagues analysed the mitochondrial DNA of specimens across its range in 2005. They recovered four distinct lineages (clades); clade\xa0I (a New Guinea lineage of smaller snakes) diverged from the rest between six and four million years ago (Late Miocene to Early Pliocene), with the other three diverging in the Pleistocene. Clade\xa0II corresponded to a lineage of large snakes found across Australia, clade\xa0III was a dwarf form from the Kimberley, and clade\xa0IV contained two dwarf forms from northwestern Queensland and the Northern Territory, each of which was likely to be a distinct species.  In 2017, British herpetologist Simon Maddock and colleagues published a genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA on the genus, and confirmed clade\xa0I was P. rossignoli, clade\xa0II was P. australis, clade\xa0III is an as yet unnamed dwarf species, and clade\xa0IV is P. pailsi and P. weigeli. They also determined that P. australis was most closely related to P. butleri, the spotted mulga snake.\n\nAustralian medical researcher Struan Sutherland pointed out that the name "king brown snake" is a problem, as its venom is not neutralised by brown snake antivenom, which could endanger snake bite victims; he recommended dropping the name and the old term "Darwin brown snake", and using "mulga snake", instead. Further complicating the issue, the term "king brown snake" has been applied to any large brown snake. Australian snake expert Glenn Shea has also pointed out that "mulga snake" has issues in that the species lives in a wide range of habitats in addition to mulga. It has also been called the "Pilbara cobra". Australian zoologist Gerard Krefft called it the orange-bellied brown snake. In the Kaytetye language spoken in Central Australia, it is known as atetherr-ayne-wene, "budgerigar-eater". The term "king brown" refers to the great size of individuals in the north and northwest of Australia, which can exceed 3\xa0m (10\xa0ft) in length; it is the largest and most dangerous elapid of those regions. In Southwest Australia, where the species is up to 2\xa0m (6\xa0ft 7\xa0in), it is also known as the common mulga snake, distinguishing it from the spotted mulga snake Pseudechis butleri.\n\nAustralia\'s largest venomous snake, the king brown snake can reach 2.0 to 2.5\xa0m (6.6 to 8.2\xa0ft) in length with a weight of 3 to 6\xa0kg (6.6 to 13.2\xa0lb), with males around 20% larger than females. The longest confirmed individual was 3.3\xa0m (11\xa0ft) in length. The king brown snake is robust, with a head slightly wider than the body, prominent cheeks and small eyes with red-brown irises, and a dark tongue. The head is demarcated from the body by a slight neck. Scales on the upper-parts, flanks and tail are two toned—pale or greenish yellow at the base and various shades of tan or copper, or all shades of brown from pale to blackish towards the rear. This gives the snake a reticulated pattern. The tail is often darker, while the crown is the same colour as the body. The belly is cream, white or salmon and can have orange marks.\n\nThe colours of the snakes\' upper parts and sides differ from area to area within their range; those from northern Australia are tan, those from deserts in Central Australia have prominent white marks on each scale, giving a patterned appearance, and those from southern parts of its range are darker, even blackish. In Western Australia, king brown snakes south of a line through Jurien Bay, Badgingarra, New Norcia, and Quairading are significantly darker in colour.\n\nThe number and arrangement of scales on a snake\'s body are key elements of identification to species level. The king brown snake has 17 rows of dorsal scales at mid-body, 185 to 225 ventral scales, 50 to 75 subcaudal scales (all undivided, or anterior ones undivided and posterior divided, or all divided), and a divided anal scale. The temporolabial scale and last (sixth) supralabial scale (both above the snake\'s mouth) are fused in the eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis) but separate in the king brown snake.\n\nThe king brown snake can be confused with brown snakes of the genus Pseudonaja, the olive python (Liasis olivaceus), water python (Liasis fuscus), spotted mulga snake, or coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) where they co-occur.\n\nKing brown snakes occur in all states of Australia except for Victoria and Tasmania. It has become rare or vanished from parts of coastal Queensland. The eastern limit of its range runs from Gladstone in central Queensland, and south through Gayndah, Dalby, the Warrumbungles, southwest to Condobolin and the vicinity of Balranald and then across to Port Pirie in South Australia. The southwestern limit of its range runs from Ceduna in South Australia, west through the northern Nullarbor Plain to Kalgoorlie, Narrogin and on coastal plains north of Perth.\n\nKing brown snakes are habitat generalists, inhabiting woodlands, hummock grasslands, chenopod scrublands, and gibber or sandy deserts nearly devoid of vegetation. Within the arid to semiarid parts of their range, however, they prefer areas of greater moisture such as watercourses.\n\nThey are often observed at modified habitats such as wheat fields, rubbish piles, and vacated buildings; individuals may become trapped in mine shafts and wellbores. Fieldwork near Alice Springs showed that they prefer areas with buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), a common introduced weed in Central Australia, possibly because of the dense, year-round cover it provides.\n\nThe king brown snake is mostly crepuscular—active at dusk, and is less active during the middle of the day and between midnight and dawn, retiring to crevices in the soil, old animal burrows, or under rocks or logs. During warmer months, its activity shifts to later after dusk and into the evening. Across its range, it is more active during the day in cooler climates and at night in hotter climates.\n\nThe breeding season begins with males engaging in wrestling combat, each attempting to push the other over for the right to mate with a female. Mating follows—in the early Southern Hemisphere spring in southwest Western Australia, mid-spring in the Eyre Peninsula, and with the wet season in the north of the country. The species is oviparous, with one unverified claim of viviparity. Females produce a clutch of four to 19 eggs, averaging around 10, with longer females laying larger clutches, generally 39 to 45 days after mating has taken place. Eggs take about 70 to 100 days to hatch. The incubating temperature has been recorded as between 22 and 32\xa0°C (72 and 90\xa0°F). The eggs average 40.1\xa0mm (1+5⁄8\xa0in) in length by 22.9\xa0mm (7⁄8\xa0in) in width and weigh 13.1\xa0g (0.46\xa0oz) each. Baby snakes average 22.6\xa0cm (8+7⁄8\xa0in) in length and weigh 9.4\xa0g (0.33\xa0oz) on hatching.\n\nKing brown snakes have been reported to live up to 25 years in captivity.\n\nThe king brown snake is a generalist predator, preying on frogs, lizards including small monitors, skinks, geckos and agamids, other snakes including whip snakes, brown snakes, the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), southern shovel-nosed snake (Brachyurophis semifasciatus), Gould\'s hooded snake (Parasuta gouldii) and crowned snake (Elapognathus coronatus), birds such as thornbills, and small mammals such as rodents and dasyurids. and spiders such as tarantulas, mouse spiders, and the infamous funnel-web spiders.  The species has been reported eating roadkill, as well as the sloughed skins of other reptiles, and is known to exhibit cannibalism. Specimens in captivity have been observed eating their own faeces. It is opportunistic, eating a higher proportion of frogs in wetter areas.\n\nKing brown snakes are sensitive to cane toad toxins and have died after eating them. Despite this, field research before and after the arrival of cane toads to the Adelaide River floodplain in the Northern Territory did not show a decline in king brown snake numbers, though this could have been coincidental; the population of this species had already declined in the region.\n\nThe king brown snake accounted for 4% of identified snakebites in Australia between 2005 and 2015, with no deaths recorded. The last recorded death occurred in 1969, when a 20-year-old man was bitten while reaching around for a packet of cigarettes under his bed in Three Springs, Western Australia. The man was treated over two days, with twice daily injections of death adder, brown snake and tiger snake antivenin, yet died in 37 hours despite this medical attention. This incident led to the introduction of Papuan black snake antivenom for treatment of king brown snake envenomation. Before this it had been confirmed in one fatality and suspected in another in the early 1960s. Venomous snakes normally only bite humans when disturbed. King brown snakes have been noted, however, to bite people who were asleep at the time. Furthermore, a significant number of victims have been snake handlers. These have resulted in a high proportion of bites occurring on upper limbs. The king brown snake is classified as a snake of medical importance by the World Health Organization.[a]\n\nThe king brown snake can bite repeatedly and chew to envenomate a victim. Considerable pain, swelling, and tissue damage often occur at the site of a king brown snake bite. Local necrosis has been recorded. In 1998, a person bitten 9–12 times on his arm required an amputation of the envenomed limb. He reported later that he had impulsively decided to commit suicide by placing his hand in a bag with a king brown snake inside and stirring it up. A large king brown snake delivers on average 180\xa0mg of venom in one bite. A 2.5\xa0m (8\xa0ft 2\xa0in) long king brown snake milked by snake handler John Cann produced 1350\xa0mg, and then 580, 920, and 780\xa0mg at three, four, and five months after the first milking. This record was broken in 2016, when a king brown snake named "Chewie"—also 2.5\xa0m (8\xa0ft 2\xa0in) long—produced 1500\xa0mg of venom at the Australian Reptile Park. The volume of venom produced in laboratories is equivalent to the amounts produced by the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) and gaboon adder (Bitis gabonica). In a laboratory experiment on mice, not only did the king brown snake inject far more venom than other species of dangerous snake, very little of its venom (0.07\xa0mg of 62\xa0mg) was left on the skin. When using 0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline rather than saline alone, the venom has a murine median lethal dose (LD50) of 1.91\xa0mg/kg (0.866\xa0mg/lb) when administered subcutaneously.\n\nThe main toxic agents of king brown snake venom are myotoxins hazardous to striated muscles and kidney cells. Toxic effects are proportional to the amount of venom in the victim. Nonspecific symptoms of poisoning are common and include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, generalized sweating (diaphoresis), and headache. Impaired clotting (coagulopathy) is common, and can be diagnosed with an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Symptoms of myotoxicity (muscle damage) include muscle pain and weakness in the presence of an elevated creatine kinase (CK). King brown snake venom has some haemolytic activity, and some patients get a short-term fall in red blood cells.\n\nA major component of king brown snake venom are phospholipase A2 enzymes, which have diverse effects that are commonly found in snake venoms. These proteins are directly toxic on muscle tissue due to their sheer volume in the venom, and are destructive to cell membranes and liberate lysophospholipids (involved in cell lysis) and arachidonate (a precursor in inflammatory response). Their venom can lead to rhabdomyolysis. Despite containing a number of agents with phospholipase A2 activity, king brown snake venom exhibits little neurotoxicity.\n\nThe venom has multiple proteins with antibiotic activity, including two L-amino-acid oxidases (LAO1 and LAO2) that exhibit activity against the pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila, which is commonly present in frogs. Also present are three protein isoforms of transferrin; transferrin binds serum iron (Fe3+), which makes the environment less hospitable for bacteria and hence has an antibiotic effect. Pseudechetoxin and pseudecin are two proteins that block cyclic nucleotide–gated ion channels, including those present in retinal photoreceptors and olfactory receptor neurons.\n\nStandard first-aid treatment for any suspected bite from a venomous snake uses a pressure bandage to the bite site. The victims should move as little as possible and be conveyed to a hospital or clinic, where they should be monitored for at least 24 hours. The tetanus vaccine is given, though the mainstay of treatment is the administration of the appropriate antivenom. Black-snake antivenom is used to treat bites from this species. Christopher Johnston and colleagues propose giving antivenom immediately if king brown snake envenoming is suspected, as a delay of more than two hours did not prevent muscle damage in a review of treated snakebite victims. They add that it is reasonable to assume that if a snakebite victim had a raised aPTT and signs of haemolysis, then a king brown snake is the culprit. Shahab Razavi and colleagues add that more than one vial of antivenom might be needed if envenoming is severe.\n\nKing brown snakes are readily available in Australia via breeding in captivity. They are regarded as straightforward to keep, due to the low likelihood of biting and relatively low toxicity of their venom, though the potentially large amount injected makes it more hazardous.\n\nThe king brown snake is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Small snakes may be eaten by birds of prey. In contrast, old snakes are frequently infested with ticks.\n\nMutitjulu Waterhole at Uluru marks the site of the battle between two Central Australian ancestral beings Kuniya (woma python woman) and Liru (king brown snake man). Here, Kuniya avenged the death of her nephew, who was fatally speared by Liru, by striking him with her digging stick.\n\nAmong the Djambarrpuyngu clan of the Yolngu people in northeastern Arnhem Land, King Brown Snake is the Ngurruyurrtjurr ancestor, and its homeland is Flinders Point in Arnhem Land.\n\nKnown as darrpa to indigenous people of East Arnhem land, the king brown snake was historically responsible for deaths there. Folk treatment involved capturing the snake and watching it bleed, which would supposedly make the victim recover. If the snake were killed, its victim would die also. Another folk remedy involved blowing smoke through a hollow branch or pandanus leaf onto the victim sitting by a campfire. If the smoke resembled the mali, or immaterial form, of a snake, then the person would die, as the victim of a ragalk (sorcerer).\n\nIn Kunwinjku country in West Arnhem Land, the king brown snake is known as dadbe. The Kurulk clan would not collect white paint from a site in the wet season, as they believed it was the snake\'s faeces, and they were afraid of its anger.\n\nKurrmurnnyini is a lagoon and complex of sandstone outcrops near Borroloola in the southwestern Gulf Country in the Northern Territory. Here the King Brown Snake Ancestral Being—balngarrangarra in Gudanji and ngulwa in Yanyuwa—was sleeping about 1.5\xa0km (0.93\xa0mi) north of the lagoon when it was disturbed by ngabaya—ancestral spirit men. Angrily, he bit the rocks, which became tainted and poisonous, and an instrument of narnu‐bulabula (sorcery). Local sorcerers would cast a spell by inserting a potential victim\'s item of clothing in a hole in the rock or sharpening a stick and calling out their name while inserting it in the rock face. The victim would then perish. Only men descended from King Brown Snake Ancestor could be sorcerers, though others might hire them. Local people feared and avoided the location.\n\nThe title character picks up a king brown snake in the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee.'], 'score': 4.517558}, {'id': 'Hemiaspis', 'name': ['Hemiaspis'], 'introduction': ['\n\nHemiaspis is a genus of venomous snakes of the Elapidae family.

It is from the Austrelaps genus along with two other species of copperhead, the Highland and Lowland copperhead snakes.\n\nAdult pygmy copperhead snakes grow to an average of 80\xa0cm (31\xa0in) making it the smallest of Australian copperheads. It preys on small reptiles and frogs. Their bite is considered possibly lethal but they are unlikely to attack unless stepped on or purposely provoked.\n\nThey are not considered to be in need of conservation.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The pygmy copperhead was first described as the Alecto Labialis by Giorgio Jan in 1859. This name was also briefly given to the White-lipped Snake in 1873 by Jan and associate Ferdinando Sordelli.\n\nIt was formerly included in Austrelaps superbus which, at the time, also included the highland and lowland copperhead snakes under the same name. The three species were officially separated in 1991 in a publication from P. A. Rawlinson, detailing key differences in appearance, distribution and behaviour between each type. This publication renames the pygmy copperhead to Austrelaps labialis, with Austrelaps superbus remaining the name for the highland copperhead.\n\nSnake-catcher Raymond Hoser has disputed the separation of species in Austrelaps, claiming the main separation is related only to environmentally influenced changes. His paper has however been challenged by the wider community.\n\nThe common naming of the snake refers to the colouration of the scales on top of its body and those surrounding the snake’s snout and eyes, and "pygmy" refers to the species being smaller than the highland and lowland counterparts. Other common names include the pigmy copperhead, dwarf copperhead, Adelaide Hills copperhead and Jan’s copperhead.\n\nIt is not closely related to the American copperhead, Agkistrodon contortrix (Viperidae).\n\nThe pygmy copperhead is the smallest of Australian copperhead snakes. It is expected for the males to grow to a larger size than the females, but the pygmy copperhead\'s ratio is more marked than most other snake species. On average, the adult male snake reaches 80\xa0cm (31.5\xa0in) in length, with larger specimens reaching 120\xa0cm (47.2\xa0in) long. The total length the snake can reach has been debated, with previous publications and research only finding specimens of 60\xa0cm, 70\xa0cm and 85\xa0cm.\n\nOn both sexes, the dorsal scales come in shades of brown to grey, with a notable darker stripe along the spine. The abdominal area is cream to light-grey in colouration, with varying intensities of red along the edges before transitioning to the brown-grey backside. The labial scales of the pygmy copperhead are barred with dark colouration. There can be from 140 to 165 ventral scales and 35–55 subcaudal scales, with an average of 15 rows of scales along their mid-bodies, and a single anal scale.\n\nNewborns often have paler backsides in comparison to adult pygmy copperheads.\n\nThe pygmy copperhead is endemic to Australia and restricted to a small section of South Australia (state), particularly Kangaroo Island and immediately adjacent mainland within the Fleurieu Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges.\n\nThe limited area is characteristically moist, with an average yearly rainfall of 600–800\xa0mm (23.6–31.5\xa0in) and milder summer temperatures, 23–25\xa0°C (73.4–77.0\xa0°F).  They are found living in concentrated numbers near streams, in swamps, marshland and open sclerophyll woodlands and forests. The cold temperatures in these areas are notably too low for many other reptilian species.\n\nThere have been sightings of individual pygmy copperheads in the Adelaide Hills, as well as on islands between the Australian mainland and Tasmania, including Flinders Island, Hunter Island, Kangaroo Island, King Island, Preservation Island and Great Dog Island, probably from having accidentally stowed away on boats.\n\nThe pygmy copperhead is a common species but rarely seen. It is generally unobtrusive, commonly hiding under leaf litter, old iron and haystacks. The lowland and highland species can be potentially dangerous, but being smaller, the pygmy is not known for being aggressive. They are all considered non-threatening\xa0unless provoked. Combat between males signifies sexual maturity in snakes, but it has not been observed in pygmy copperheads, despite the lowland and highland species exhibiting at two years of age.\n\nBeing carnivorous, the pygmy copperhead\'s diet consists of smaller ectotherms, most commonly including small lizards, frogs and tadpoles. They are known to feed more frequently than highland and lowland copperheads. There have also been reports of cannibalism in the pygmy copperheads.\n\nBites are considered lethal without prompt anti-venom intervention, with possible irreversible presynaptic damage. The pygmy copperhead’s venom is classed as strongly neurotoxic, with toxicity similar to that of the Indian cobra. It is weakly coagulant and strongly anticoagulant, with the ability to be both blood and muscle destroying. Antivenom developed through the tiger snake is unable to completely neutralise the neurotoxicity of the whole venom, nor a modified version in research lab trials.\n\nThe pygmy copperhead is viviparous, commonly giving live birth to seven young in each litter, with an average maximum of 20 young in a single litter.  The litter size is half that of the other Australian copperheads, attributed to their smaller body size and the maternal snout-vent length (SVL) and litter size ratio. There also appears to be a skewed sex ratio towards males. Female ovulation in the pygmy copperhead is in spring, but field research found that only two thirds of surveyed (apparently adult) females were reproductive, suggesting that females do not reproduce every year.'], 'score': 4.47668}]}}
