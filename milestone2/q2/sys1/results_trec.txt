The type and only species is L. mafube, known from a singular incomplete postcranial specimen. A quadruped, it was one of the first giant sauropodomorphs, reaching a weight of around 12 tonnes (13 short tons), despite not having evolved columnar limbs like its later huge relatives.'], 'sections': ["Ledumahadi was likely a quadruped, as determined by analysis of the circumference of its humerus and femur compared to those of other dinosaurs. It would have had very large, robust forelimbs, consistent with those of its relatives. Unlike those of later sauropods, these limbs were naturally flexed, as opposed to being purely columnar.\n\nAt its time in the Early Jurassic epoch, Ledumahadi is thought to have been the largest land animal that had ever lived. At the age of 14 years, L. mafube is estimated to have reached a maximum size of around 12 tonnes (13 short tons) in body mass, significantly larger than its relatives. L. mafube was more comparable to the later sauropod Diplodocus in body mass. An ichnotaxon named Tetrasauropus belongs to a sauropodomorph that is estimated to have a hip height of 2\xa0m (6.6\xa0ft), meaning that it likely belongs to Ledumahadi.\n\nA phylogenetic analysis of Ledumahadi mafube was performed by McPhee and colleagues, which found it to belong to a recently recognised clade of sauropodiformes called Lessemsauridae, including the closely related South African Antetonitrus and Lessemsaurus from Argentina. Another lessemsaurid described in 2018, Ingentia, could not be included in their analysis but was also recognised as belonging to Lessemsauridae. The results of McPhee and colleagues' analysis are shown in the cladogram below:\n\nYunnanosaurus\n\nMussaurus\n\nAardonyx\n\nNMQR 1551\n\nNMQR 3314\n\nBlikanasaurus\n\nCamelotia\n\nLessemsaurus\n\nAntetonitrus\n\nLedumahadi\n\nLeonerasaurus\n\nGongxianosaurus\n\nPulanesaura\n\nSauropoda\n\nThe size of the taxon was deemed to be important in the wider picture of sauropodomorph evolution, similar to its other lessemsaurid relatives. Living only a few million years after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, it indicates that this event must have either had only a small effect on body size within the sauropodomorph lineage, or may have not affected it at all. Significance was also found in the magnitude of the size itself—it lacked the columnar limbs that characterized its more derived relatives, thought to be a key adaptation in body size evolution. Ornithischian dinosaurs reach their largest sizes around a similar size of 12 to 17 tonnes in weight. This may have been the upper limit for dinosaurs without adopting the characteristics found in true sauropods, which grew to be several times the weight of Ledumahadi."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 7.785235}, {'id': 'Deinotheriidae', 'name': ['Deinotheriidae'], 'introduction': ['\n\nSubfamily †Chilgatheriinae\n\nSubfamily †Deinotheriinae\n\nDeinotheriidae ("terrible beasts") is a family of prehistoric elephant-like proboscideans that lived during the Cenozoic era, first appearing in Africa, then spreading across South Asia (Indo-Pakistan) and Europe.  During that time, they changed very little, apart from growing much larger in size; by the late Miocene, they had become the largest land animals of their time.  Their most distinctive features were their lack of upper tusks and downward-curving tusks on the lower jaw.\n\nDeinotheres were not very diverse; the only three known genera are Chilgatherium, Prodeinotherium, and Deinotherium.  These form an evolutionary succession, with each new genus replacing the preceding one. The last deinotheres persisted until the end of the Early Pleistocene in Africa, around 1 million years ago.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The body shape and proportions of deinotheres were very much like those of modern elephants.  The legs were long, like modern elephants, but the skull was rather flatter than that of true elephants.  The upper jaw lacked incisor and canine teeth, but possessed five low-crowned molars on each side, with the same number in the lower jaw.  Deinotheres used their front teeth for crushing their food, and the back teeth for shearing (slicing) the plant material. The front part of the lower jaw was turned downwards and bore the two tusk-like incisors.  These curved downwards and backwards in a sort of huge hook and constituted the most distinct feature of the deinotheres. The tusks were used to strip vegetation rather than for digging.\n\nWhile the earliest deinothere Chilgatherium probably weighed only around 1.5 tonnes (3,300\xa0lb) and was less than 2 metres (6.6\xa0ft) tall, some species of Deinotherium represent among the largest known proboscideans, with shoulder heights of over 4 metres (13\xa0ft) and body masses around 12 tonnes (26,000\xa0lb), considerably exceeding living African bush elephants in body size.\n\nDeinotheres were "shearing browsers" adapted for feeding on plants above ground level. The way they chewed their food was probably similar to that of modern tapirs, with the front teeth being used to crush the food, while the second and third molars have a strong vertical shearing action, with little lateral (side-to-side) movement.  This chewing action differs from both that of gomphotheres (lateral grinding) and elephants (horizontal shearing). Deinothere molars show little wear, indicating a diet of soft, non-gritty, forest vegetation, with the down-turned lower tusks being used for stripping bark or other vegetation.\n\nDeinotherium giganteum has a more elongated lower fore limb than early and middle Miocene Prodeinotherium, indicating a more efficient stride as an adaptation to the spread of savannas in Europe during the late Miocene.  Deinotheres probably migrated from forest to forest, traversing the wide and (to them) useless grasslands.\n\nThe ancestry and evolutionary relationships of the deinotheres remain obscure.  They are thought to be related to the barytheres, due to similarities in the structure of the teeth.  They clearly diverged from the rest of the proboscideans at a very early date.  In the 1970s, several researchers placed them in a separate order to the Proboscidea, but this view is not followed nowadays.\n\nThe oldest known deinothere is Chilgatherium harrisi from the late Oligocene.  Its fossil remains have been found in the district of Chilga in Ethiopia (hence the name).  This indicates that, like other proboscideans, deinotheres evolved in Africa.  Chilgatherium was quite small, about midway between a large pig and a small hippopotamus in size.\n\nBy the early Miocene, deinotheres had grown to the size of a small elephant and had migrated to Eurasia.  Several species are known, all belonging to the genus Prodeinotherium.\n\nDuring the late middle Miocene, these modest-seized proboscideans were replaced by much larger forms across Eurasia.  In Europe, Prodeinotherium bavaricum appeared in the early Miocene mammal faunal zone MN 4, but was soon replaced by Deinotherium giganteum in the middle Miocene.  Likewise in Asia, Prodeinotherium is known from the early Miocene strata in the Bugti Hills, and continued into the middle Miocene Chinji Formation, where it was replaced by D. indicum.\n\nWhile these Miocene deinotheres were dispersed widely and evolved to huge elephant sizes, they were not as common as the contemporary (but smaller) Elephantoidea.  Fossil remains of this age are known from the France, Germany, Greece, Malta, and northern India and Pakistan. These consist chiefly of teeth and the bones of the skull.\n\nAfter the extinction of the paraceratheres at the Oligocene-Miocene transition, the deinotheres were (and remained) the largest animals walking the Earth.\n\nThe late Miocene was the heyday of the giant deinotheres.  D. giganteum was common from Vallesian and Turolian localities in Europe.  Prodeinotherium, which was reasonably well represented in the early Miocene of Africa, was succeeded by D. bozasi at the beginning of the late Miocene.  And in Asia, D. indicum was most common in the late-Miocene Dhok Pathan Formation.\n\nFossil teeth of D. giganteum, from the late-Miocene Sinap Formation at the Turkish site of Kayadibi are larger than those from older localities, such as Eppelsheim, Wissberg, and Montredon, indicating a tendency for increasing size of members of the species over time.  These were the biggest animals of their day, protected from both predators and rival herbivores by virtue of their huge bulk. The largest mammoths did not approach them in size until the Pleistocene.\n\nWith the end of the Miocene, deinothere fortunes declined.  D. indicum died out about 7 million years ago, possibly driven to extinction by the same process of climate change that had previously eliminated the even more enormous Paraceratherium.  While in Europe, D. giganteum continued, albeit with dwindling numbers, until the middle Pliocene; the most recent specimen is from Romania.\n\nIn its original African homeland, Deinotherium continued to flourish throughout the Pliocene, and fossils have been uncovered at several of the African sites where remains of hominids have also been found.\n\nThe last deinothere species to become extinct was D. bozasi.  The youngest known specimens are from the Kanjera Formation, Kenya, about 1 million years ago (early Pleistocene).  The causes of the extinction of such a successful and long-lived animal are not known, although a small number of other species of African megafauna also died out at this time.'], 'score': 6.571773}, {'id': 'Tapirus_bairdii', 'name': ['Tapirus bairdii'], 'introduction': ["\n\nTapirella bairdii\n\nThe Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), also known as the Central American tapir, is a species of tapir native to Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. It is the largest of the three species of tapir native to the Americas, as well as the largest native land mammal in both Central and South America."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The Baird\'s tapir is named after the American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird, who traveled to Mexico in 1843 and observed the animals. However, the species was first documented by another American naturalist, W. T. White.\n\nLike the other American tapirs (the mountain tapir and the South American tapir), the Baird\'s tapir is commonly called danta by people[who?] in all areas.[where?] In the regions around Oaxaca and Veracruz, it is referred to as the anteburro. Panamanians, and Colombians call it macho de monte, and in Belize, where the Baird\'s tapir is the national animal, it is known as the mountain cow.\n\nIn Mexico, it is called tzemen in Tzeltal;[citation needed] in Lacandon, it is called cash-i-tzimin, meaning "jungle horse"[citation needed] and in Tojolab\'al it is called niguanchan, meaning "big animal".[citation needed] In Panama, the Kunas people call the Baird\'s tapir moli in their colloquial language (Tule kaya), oloalikinyalilele, oloswikinyaliler, or oloalikinyappi in their political language (Sakla kaya), and ekwirmakka or ekwilamakkatola in their spiritual language (Suar mimmi kaya).[citation needed]\n\nThe Baird\'s tapir is found in many diverse vegetation types. They can withstand elevations from sea level to up to 3,600 metres (11,800\xa0ft). The animal can be found in wet areas like mangrove forests, marshes, swamp areas, and wet tropical rainforests. It also resides in drier areas like riparian woodlands, deciduous forests, and mountainous cloud forests. It prefers secondary growth forests, when available, due to increase in understory plants for foraging and protection. Food and water availability as well as protection are key factors in habitat selection.\n\nThe Baird\'s tapir has a distinctive cream-colored marking on its face, throat, and tips of its ears, with a dark spot on each cheek, behind and below the eye. The rest of its bristly hair is dark brown or grayish brown. The animal is very muscly, and about the size of a small donkey. A long thin mane is present but not always conspicuous. It has two small oval shaped eyes flush with the side of the head. Its ears are large, oval-shaped and not very mobile. Baird\'s tapirs average 2\xa0m (6\xa0ft 7\xa0in) in length, but can range between 1.8 and 2.5\xa0m (5\xa0ft 11\xa0in and 8\xa0ft 2\xa0in), not counting a stubby, vestigial tail of 5–13\xa0cm (2.0–5.1\xa0in), and 73–120\xa0cm (29–47\xa0in) in height. Body mass in adults can range from 150 to 300\xa0kg (330 to 660\xa0lb). Like the other species of tapirs, they have small, stubby tails. Their snout and upper lips project forward to create a fleshy and flexible proboscis. This proboscis is their strongest sense organ that aids in finding food and detecting physical stimuli. Their legs are short and slender; well adapted to rapid movement through underbrush. They have four toes on each front foot, and three toes on each back foot.\n\nThe gestation period is about 400 days, after which one offspring is born to an average mass of 9.4\xa0kg (21\xa0lb). Multiple births are extremely rare, but in September 2020, a Baird\'s tapir in Boston\'s Franklin Park Zoo birthed twins.\nThe babies, as with all species of tapir, have reddish-brown hair with white spots and stripes. This pattern creates a camouflage which affords them excellent protection in the shady understory of the forest. This pattern eventually fades into the adult coloration.\n\nFor the first week of their lives, infant Baird\'s tapirs are hidden in secluded locations while their mothers forage for food and return periodically to nurse them. Later, the young follow their mothers on feeding expeditions. At three weeks of age, the young are able to swim. Weaning occurs after one year, and sexual maturity is usually reached 6 to 12 months later. Baird\'s tapirs can live for over 30 years.\n\nThe Baird\'s tapir may be active at all hours, but is primarily nocturnal. It forages for leaves and fallen fruit, using well-worn tapir paths which zigzag through the thick undergrowth of the forest. The animal usually stays close to water and enjoys swimming and wading – on especially hot days, individuals will rest in a watering hole for hours with only their heads above water. When in danger, these animals will seek water.\n\nIt generally leads a solitary life, though small feeding groups are not uncommon, and individuals, especially those of different ages (young with their mothers, juveniles with adults), are often observed together. The animals communicate with one another through shrill whistles and squeaks.\n\nWhen the Baird\'s tapir mate, they form long-term monogamous pairs. These pairs are known to defend territory. Though they can breed at any point in the year, it is most common prior to rainy seasons. Both parents take part in raising the children, as they move and sleep together as a unit. The mother will guide young by a nudging movement with her proboscis.\n\nThe Baird\'s tapir has a symbiotic relationship with cleaner birds that remove ticks from its fur: the yellow-headed caracara (Milvago chimachima) and the black vulture (Coragyps atratus) have both been observed removing and eating ticks from tapirs. Baird\'s tapirs often lie down for cleaning, and also present tick-infested areas to the cleaner birds by lifting its limbs and rolling from one side to the other.\n\nThese animals also have a marginal but noted effect as seed dispersers. Guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), Sapodilla (Manilkara zapota), and Encina (Quercus oleoides) have all found to be sometimes passable through the tapir digestive system. The intense chewing of these hard seeds serve to scarify them before germination and can improve the seed\'s likelihood of success.\n\nThe Baird\'s tapir is herbivorous, rummaging from the forest floor to 1.5 metres (4\xa0ft 11\xa0in) over the ground. Leaves from an assortment of plant types provide the greater part of their eating regimen, yet they likewise eat twigs, blossoms, hedges, grasses, and fruits. Fruits tend to be favorable when in season, but it depends on its availability. Dietary makeup of plant species additionally fluctuates with season. The presence of armor or biting insects on a plant does not hinder them from consuming that plant. They burn through the majority of their waking hours foraging in a zigzag fashion.\n\nThese animals lean toward plant types of medium to tall level, yet the main plants that are totally kept away from are small, widely dispersed seedlings and large shade-level trees. By and large, it will move onto another plant before each of the leaves are consumed on the one it is presently eating. They commonly feed in enormous tree falls or secondary forests because of the great thickness of understory plants which are for, the most part, exceptionally digestible and have not many protective poisons. Once in a while they will ascend on their rear feet to arrive at leaves past their ordinary reach, or knock down slim or dead plants to get fruit or leaves. The absorption of nutrients in light of the huge volume and extreme diversity of recognizable plant parts in their excrement is by all accounts poor.\n\nAttacks on humans are rare and normally in self-defense. In 2006, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez Echandi, the former Costa Rican Minister of Environment and Energy, was attacked and injured by a Baird\'s tapir after he followed it off the trail.\n\nDue to their size, adults can be potentially dangerous to humans, and should not be approached if spotted in the wild. The animal is most likely to follow or chase a human for a bit, though they have been known to charge and bite humans on rare occasions.\n\nAccording to the IUCN, the Baird\'s tapir is endangered. There are many contributing factors in the decline of the species, including loss of habitat from deforestation, forest fires, and large scale industrial projects. In certain areas, poaching, disease transmission from domesticated animals, pollution of native water bodies, and the developing effects of climate change all threaten this species. Though the animal is only hunted by a few humans, any loss of life is a serious blow to the tapir population, especially because their reproductive rate is so slow.\n\nIn Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama, hunting of the Baird\'s tapirs is illegal, but the laws protecting them are often unenforced. The issues of illegal logging in conserved areas also threaten these animals. Therefore, many conservationists are urging for the protection of existing habitat by improving maintenance and protection in existing habitat, through strengthening partnership with indigenous territories. Goals also include re-establishing corridors of connection between existing habitat including the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, and improving education of locals to uphold and protect biodiversity.\n\nCaptive breeding programs are helpful with many large terrestrial species, but there is a study showing a small population of Baird\'s tapirs in North American and Central American zoos had inbreeding and divergence from the wild population. Conservationists are urging for thoughtful approaches to breeding programs that focus on maintaining genetic diversity.\n\nDue to its size, an adult Baird\'s tapir has very few natural predators, with only large adult American crocodiles (4 metres or 13 feet or more) and adult jaguars capable of preying on Baird\'s tapirs. Even in these cases, the outcomes are unpredictable and often in the Baird\'s tapir\'s favor, as is evident on multiple Baird\'s tapirs documented in Corcovado National Park with large claw marks covering their hides. However, juveniles may be preyed on by smaller crocodiles and by pumas. In a remote video-monitor,  a spectacled bear was captured attacking an adult tapir perhaps nearly twice its own body mass.'], 'score': 6.464361}, {'id': 'Mesoplodon', 'name': ['Mesoplodon'], 'introduction': ['\n\n16, See text.\n\nMesoplodont whales are 16 species of toothed whale in the genus Mesoplodon, making it the largest genus in the cetacean order.

A new species was described in 2021. They are the most poorly known group of large mammals.

They are typically found in groups, possibly segregated between sexes. Some species are so uncommon, they have yet to be observed alive. On the surface, they are typically very slow swimmers and do not make obvious blows. They have never been observed raising their flukes above the water. They are all very deep divers, and many feed entirely on squid.\n\nThe mesoplodonts are completely unknown as far as population estimates are concerned.

This could indicate that they were social animals which butted heads for breeding privileges.\n\nDespite resembling the rhinoceros, it was larger than any living rhinoceros: the living animal easily approached the size of the African forest elephant, the third-largest land animal today.

It may have had fleshy lips and a long tongue for carefully selecting food.\n\nThe skeleton of an adult male was found with partially healed rib fractures, which supports the theory that males used their \'horns\' to fight each other. No creature living in Megacerops\' time and area except another Megacerops could have inflicted such an injury. The breathing movements prevented the fractures from completely healing. The adults may have also used their horns to defend themselves and their calves from predators, such as hyaenodonts, entelodonts, Bathornis or nimravids.\n\nFossils were uncovered in the northern plains states. Life-sized models of Megacerops families (a male, female, and juvenile) are displayed at the James E. Martin Paleontological Research Laboratory, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, and a different set at the Canadian Museum of Nature.\n\nMany remains have been found in South Dakota and Nebraska. In the past, specimens exposed by severe rainstorms were found by Native Americans of the Sioux tribes.

Ellerman & Morrison-Scott 1951\nRhachianectidae Weber 1904\n\nRorquals (/ˈrɔːrkwəlz/) are the largest group of baleen whales, comprising the family Balaenopteridae, which contains nine extant species in two genera.

The family name Balaenopteridae is from the type genus, Balaenoptera.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['All members of the family have a series of longitudinal folds of skin running from below the mouth back to the navel (except the sei whale and common minke whale, which have shorter grooves).  These furrows allow the mouth to expand immensely when feeding. These "pleated throat grooves" distinguish balaenopterids from other whales.\n\nRorquals are slender and streamlined in shape, compared with their relatives the right whales, and most have narrow, elongated flippers. They have a dorsal fin, situated about two-thirds the way back. Most rorquals feed by gulping in water, and then pushing it out through the baleen plates with their tongue; the exception is the gray whale, which gulps in and filters large amounts of marine sediments from the seafloor. They feed on crustaceans, such as krill, but also on various fish, such as herrings and sardines.\n\nGestation in rorquals lasts 11–12 months, so that both mating and birthing occur at the same time of year. Cows give birth to a single calf, which is weaned after 6–12 months, depending on species. Of some species, adults live in small groups, or "pods" of two to five individuals.  For example, humpback whales have a fluid social structure, often engaging behavioral practices in a pod, other times being solitary.\n\nDistribution is worldwide: the blue, fin, humpback, and the sei whales are found in all major oceans; the common (northern) and Antarctic (southern) minke whale species are found in all the oceans of their respective hemispheres; either of Bryde\'s whale and Eden\'s whale occur in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, being absent only from the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic; and the gray whale is found in the northern Pacific Ocean, although it was also found in the Atlantic Ocean in historic times. Rice\'s whale has the smallest distribution of rorquals and possibly baleen whales in general, being endemic to a small portion of the Gulf of Mexico west of the Florida peninsula and south of Alabama and the Florida panhandle, although it likely formerly had a much wider distribution in the Gulf.\n\nMost rorquals are strictly oceanic: the exceptions are the gray whale, Bryde\'s whale, Eden\'s whale, and Rice\'s whale (which are usually found close to shore all year round) and the humpback whale (which is oceanic but passes close to shore when migrating). It is the largest and the smallest types — the blue whale and Antarctic minke whale — that occupy the coldest waters in the extreme south; the fin whale tends not to approach so close to the ice shelf; the sei whale tends to stay further north again. (In the northern hemisphere, where the continents distort weather patterns and ocean currents, these movements are less obvious, although still present.) Within each species, the largest individuals tend to approach the poles more closely, while the youngest and fittest ones tend to stay in warmer waters before leaving on their annual migration.\n\nMost rorquals breed in tropical waters during the winter, then migrate back to the polar feeding grounds rich in plankton and krill for the short polar summer.\n\nAs well as other methods, rorquals obtain prey by lunge-feeding on bait balls. Lunge feeding is an extreme feeding method, where the whale accelerates to a high velocity and then opens its mouth to a large gape angle. This generates the water pressure required to expand its mouth and engulf and filter a huge amount of water and fish. The gray whale does not lunge feed, as it gulps in sediments from the seafloor rather than water.\n\nRorquals have a number of anatomical features that enable them to do this, including bilaterally separate mandibles, throat pleats that can expand to huge size, and a unique sensory organ consisting of a bundle of mechanoreceptors that helps their brains to coordinate the engulfment action. Furthermore, their large nerves are flexible so that they can stretch and recoil. In fact, they give rorquals the ability to open their mouths so wide that they would be capable of taking in water at volumes greater than their own sizes. These nerves are packed into a central core area that is surrounded by elastin fibers. Opening the mouth causes the nerves to unfold, and they snap back after the mouth is closed. According to Potvin and Goldbogen, lunge feeding in rorquals represents the largest biomechanical event on Earth.\n\nFormerly, the rorqual family Balaenopteridae was split into two subfamilies, the Balaenopterinae and the Megapterinae, with each subfamily containing one genus, Balaenoptera and Megaptera, respectively. However, the phylogeny of the various rorqual species shows the current division is paraphyletic, and in 2005, the division into subfamilies was dropped. Two genetic studies, one in 2018 and one in 2020, suggest that the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) be counted among the rorquals, being more derived than the two minke whales but basal to the humpback whale, fin whale, and the other taxa classified in Balaenoptera.\n\nThe discovery of a new species of balaenopterid, Omura\'s whale (Balaenoptera omurai), was announced in November 2003, which looks similar to, but smaller than, the fin whale; individuals of this species were found in Indo-Pacific waters. The discovery of the highly endangered Rice\'s whale was announced in 2021 after a genetic study found it to be distinct from Bryde\'s whale; this species is known from a small portion of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn 2012, the following alternate taxonomy was presented:'], 'score': 6.240667}, {'id': 'Harpagornis_moorei', 'name': ['Harpagornis moorei'], 'introduction': ["\n\nHaast's eagle (Hieraaetus moorei) is an extinct species of eagle that lived in the South Island of New Zealand, commonly accepted to be the pouākai of Māori mythology. It is the largest eagle known to have existed, with an estimated weight of 10–18 kilograms (22–40 pounds), compared to the next-largest and extant harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), at up to 9\xa0kg (20\xa0lb). Its massive size is explained as an evolutionary response to the size of its prey—the flightless moa—the largest of which could weigh 200\xa0kg (440\xa0lb). Haast's eagle became extinct around 1445, following the arrival of the Māori, who hunted moa to extinction, introduced the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), and destroyed large tracts of forest by fire."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['Haast\'s eagle was first scientifically described by Julius von Haast in 1871 from remains discovered by the Canterbury Museum taxidermist, Frederick Richardson Fuller, in a former marsh. Haast named the eagle Harpagornis moorei after George Henry Moore, the owner of the Glenmark Estate, where the bones of the bird were found. The genus name was from the Greek harpax, meaning "grappling hook", and ornis, meaning "bird". DNA analysis later showed that this bird is related most closely to the much smaller little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides) as well as the booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) and not, as previously thought, to the large wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax). Harpagornis moorei was therefore reclassified as Hieraaetus moorei.\n\nH. moorei is estimated to have diverged from these smaller eagles as recently as 1.8\xa0million to 700,000 years ago. If this estimate is correct, its increase in weight by ten to fifteen times is an exceptionally rapid weight increase. The suggested increase in the average weight of Haast\'s eagle over that period would therefore represent the largest, fastest evolutionary increase in average weight of any known vertebrate species. This was made possible in part by the presence of large prey and the absence of competition from other large predators, an example of ecological release and island gigantism. A recent mitochondrial DNA study found it to be more closely related to the little eagle than the booted eagle, with an estimated divergence from the little eagle around 2.2\xa0million years ago. It was placed in the genus Aquila by recent taxonomists.\n\nHaast\'s eagle was one of the largest known true raptors. In length and weight, it was even larger than the largest living vultures (the Andean condor or the black vulture). Another giant bird (not actually an eagle save for in name) more recently and scantily described from the fossil record, the Woodward\'s eagle, which resided in North America, rivaled the Haast\'s in at least the aspect of total length. Female eagles were larger than males. Most estimates place the female Haast\'s eagles in the range of 10–18\xa0kg (22–40\xa0lb) and males around 9–12\xa0kg (20–26\xa0lb). A comparison with living eagles of the Australasian region resulted in estimated masses in Haast\'s eagles of 11.5\xa0kg (25\xa0lb) for males and 14\xa0kg (31\xa0lb) for females. One source estimates that the largest females could have weighed more than 16.5\xa0kg (36\xa0lb). The largest extant eagles, none of which are verified to exceed 9\xa0kg (20\xa0lb) in a wild state, are about forty percent smaller in body size than Haast\'s eagles.\n\nIt had a relatively short wingspan for its size. It is estimated that the grown female typically spanned up to 2.6\xa0m (8\xa0ft 6\xa0in), possibly up to 3\xa0m (10\xa0ft) in a few cases. This wingspan is broadly similar to the larger range of female size in some extant eagles: the wedge-tailed eagle, golden eagle (A. chrysaetos), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and Steller\'s sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) are all known to exceed 2.5\xa0m (8\xa0ft 2\xa0in) in wingspan. Several of the largest extant Old World vultures, if not in mean mass or other linear measurements, probably exceed Haast\'s eagle in average wingspan as well. Haast\'s eagle\'s relatively short wingspan has sometimes led it to being incorrectly portrayed as having evolved toward flightlessness, even though evidence strongly suggests that it flew. Instead, its short and broad wings represents an evolutionary departure from the mode of its ancestors\' soaring flight in favour of navigating through a crowded woodland environment. Haast\'s eagles are likely to have hunted within the dense shrubland and forests of New Zealand, somewhat akin to other forest-dwelling raptors like the goshawks or harpy eagle.\n\nSome wing and leg remains of Haast\'s eagles permit direct comparison with living eagles. The harpy eagle, the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), and the Steller\'s sea eagle are the largest and most powerful living eagles, and the first two also have a similarly reduced relative wing-length as an adaptation to forest-dwelling. A lower mandible from the Haast\'s eagle measured 11.4\xa0cm (4+1⁄2\xa0in) and the tarsus in several Haast\'s eagle fossils has been measured from 22.7 to 24.9\xa0cm (8+15⁄16 to 9+13⁄16\xa0in). In comparison, the largest beaks of eagles today (from the Philippine and the Steller\'s sea eagle) reach a little more than 7\xa0cm (3\xa0in); and the longest tarsal measurements (from the Philippine and the Papuan eagle, Harpyopsis novaeguineae) top out around 14\xa0cm (5+1⁄2\xa0in).\n\nThe talons of the Haast\'s eagle were similar in length to those of the harpy eagle, with a front-left talon length of 4.9 to 6.15\xa0cm (1+15⁄16 to 2+7⁄16\xa0in) and a hallux-claw of possibly up to 11\xa0cm (4+1⁄2\xa0in). The Philippine eagle might be a particularly appropriate living species to compare with the Haast\'s eagle, because it too evolved in an insular environment from smaller ancestors (apparently basal snake eagles) to island gigantism in the absence of large carnivorous mammals and other competing predators. The eagle\'s talons are similar to modern eagles, suggesting that it used its talons for hunting and not scavenging. The strong legs and massive flight muscles of these eagles would have enabled the birds to take off with a jumping start from the ground, despite their great weight. The tail was almost certainly long, in excess of 50\xa0cm (20\xa0in) in female specimens, and very broad. This characteristic would compensate for the reduction in wing area by providing additional lift. Total length is estimated to have been up to 1.4\xa0m (4\xa0ft 7\xa0in) in females, with a standing height of approximately 90\xa0cm (2\xa0ft 11\xa0in) tall or perhaps slightly greater.\n\nMāori cave art depicts the Haast\'s eagle with a pale head. These Māori rock art drawings can still be found in modern-day South Canterbury near Timaru. Combined with its vulture-like feeding behaviour, this might suggest it had a bald head, or had shorter feathers on its head than elsewhere on its body.\n\nThe Haast\'s eagle predominantly preyed on large, flightless bird species, including the moa, which ultimately led to the species\' extinction. Moa would be up to fifteen times the weight of the eagle. Its large beak also could be used to rip into the internal organs of its prey and death then would have been caused by blood loss. Due to the absence of other large predators or kleptoparasites, a Haast\'s eagle could easily have monopolised a single large kill over a number of days.  Its prey, the moa, could weigh up to 200\xa0kg (440\xa0lb).\n\nA 2021 analysis showed that, while predatory, the bill of the Haast\'s eagle was functionally closer to that of the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) than to that of other eagles. This is also supported by historic Māori Cave art which depicts the Haast\'s eagle being pale-headed. It also suggests that it deployed feeding tactics more similar to those of vultures after making a kill, plunging its head into the body cavity to devour the vital organs of its prey. This may have been an adaptation as a result of the bird hunting animals much larger than itself.\n\nUntil recent human colonisation that introduced rodents and cats, the only placental land mammals found on the islands of New Zealand were three species of bat. Birds occupied or dominated all major niches in the New Zealand animal ecology. Moa were grazers, functionally similar to large ungulates, such as deer or cattle in other habitats, and Haast\'s eagles were the hunters who filled the same niche as top-niche mammalian predators.\n\nOne study estimated the total population of Haast\'s eagle at 3,000 to 4,500 breeding pairs. Early Māori settlers arrived in New Zealand sometime between AD\xa01250 and AD\xa01275, The Māori preyed heavily on large flightless birds, including all moa species. The hunting pressure from both the Māori and the eagle eventually led the moa to extinction by around 1440 to 1445. Both eagles and Māori likely competed for the same foods. Unlike the adaptable humans, eagles were dependent on the native medium and large-sized flightless birds, being specialized in hunting them. The loss of its primary prey caused the Haast\'s eagle to become extinct at about the same time as its prey.\n\nSome believe that these birds are described in many legends of the Māori mythology, under the names pouākai, Hakawai (or Hōkioi in the North Island). According to an account given to Sir George Grey—an early governor of New Zealand—Hōkioi were huge black-and-white birds with yellow-green tinged wings and a red crest. In Māori mythology, Pouākai would prey and kill humans along with moa, which scientists believe could have been possible if the name relates to the eagle, given the massive size and strength of the bird. However, it has also been argued that the "hakawai" and "hōkioi" legends refer to the Austral snipe—in particular the extinct South Island species.\n\nArtwork depicting Haast\'s eagle now may be viewed at OceanaGold\'s Heritage and Art Park at Macraes, Otago, New Zealand. The sculpture, weighing approximately 750\xa0kg (1,650\xa0lb), standing 7.5 metres (25\xa0ft) tall, and depicted with a wingspan of 11.5 metres (38\xa0ft) is constructed from stainless steel tube and sheet and was designed and constructed by Mark Hill, a sculptor from Arrowtown, New Zealand. The Haast\'s eagle also appeared in a 2003 BBC documentary Monsters We Met.\n\nThere is also a statue depicting the Haast\'s eagle in Karamea, West Coast.

The family contains the largest known species of ichthyosaurs, which include some of and possibly the largest known marine reptiles.'], 'sections': ['Shastasauridae was named by American paleontologist John Campbell Merriam in 1895 along with the newly described genus Shastasaurus. In 1999, Ryosuke Motani erected the clade Shastasauria to include Shastasaurus, Shonisaurus, and several other traditional shastasaurids, defining it as a stem-based taxon including "all merriamosaurians more closely related to Shastasaurus pacificus than to Ichthyosaurus communis." He also redefined Shastasauridae as a node-based taxon including "the last common ancestor of Shastasaurus pacificus and Besanosaurus leptorhynchus, and all its descendants" and Shastasaurinae, which Merriam named in 1908, as a stem taxon including "the last common ancestor of Shastasaurus and Shonisaurus, and all its descendants." In an alternative classification scheme, paleontologist Michael Maisch restricted Shastasauridae to the genus Shastasaurus and placed Shonisaurus and Besanosaurus in separate families, Shonisauridae and Besanosauridae, respectively. In various studies, the grouping of Shastasauridae has been variously found to be either monophyletic or paraphyletic. Studies that have recovered the group as monophyletic generally include Shastasaurus, Besanosaurus, Guanlingsaurus, Guizhouichthyosaurus, Shonisaurus and ‘Callawayia’ wolonggangense within the group.\n\nShastasaurids as typically defined have elongate bodies, with over 55 presacral vertebrae. They were the largest ichthyosaurs, with even some of the smaller species like Guanlingsaurus measuring over 8 metres (26\xa0ft) in length. One of the largest specimens was discovered in England in May 2016, when researcher and fossil collector Paul de la Salle discovered a partial jawbone measuring 96 centimeters (3.15\xa0ft) long which was catalogued as BRSMG Cg2488, also referred to as the Lilstock specimen. In 2018, Dean Lomax, de la Salle, Judy Massare, and Ramues Gallois identified the Lilstock specimen as a shastasaurid. While its incompleteness made the size of the animal difficult to suggest, it clearly was very large. Using Shonisaurus sikanniensis as a model, the researchers estimated the ichthyosaur to have been 26 meters (85\xa0ft) long, nearly the size of a blue whale. Scaling based on Besanosaurus, however, found a shorter length estimate of 22 meters (72\xa0ft). In 2024, the Lilstock specimen was referred to the newly described species Ichthyotitan, with a length estimate of up to 25 meters (82\xa0ft).\n\nUnlike other Triassic ichthyosaurs, which fed almost exclusively on cephalopods, shastasaurians fed on a variety of prey. Evidence for this prey diversity includes gut contents from Guizhouichthyosarus tangae, Shonisaurus popularis, and an unnamed specimen from the Brooks Range of Alaska.\n\nAlthough older studies have suggested that shastasaurids were suction-feeders, current research indicates that the jaws of shastasaurid ichthyosaurs do not fit the suction-feeding profile, since their short and narrow hyoid bones are unsuitable to withstand impact forces for such kind of feeding, and since some species like Shonisaurus had robust sectorial teeth with gut contents of mollusk shells and vertebrates.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 5.6054506}, {'id': 'Agrilus', 'name': ['Agrilus'], 'introduction': ['\n\nAgrilus is a genus of jewel beetles, notable for having the largest number of species (about 3000) of any single genus in the animal kingdom.'], 'sections': ['Three fossil taxa have been described:'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 5.5930824}, {'id': 'Amplectobelua', 'name': ['Amplectobelua'], 'introduction': ['\n\nAmplectobelua (meaning "embracing beast") is an extinct genus of late Early Cambrian amplectobeluid radiodont, a group of stem arthropods that mostly lived as free-swimming predators during the first half of the Paleozoic Era.'], 'sections': ['Amplectobelua was a giant radiodont, with the largest specimen of A. symbrachiata reaching up to 90\xa0cm (3.0\xa0ft) in body length excluding the frontal appendages and tail.

Like other radiodonts, Amplectobelua had a pair of jointed frontal appendages, a head covered by dorsal and lateral sclerites (the latter had been misinterpreted as huge eyes), a limbless body with dorsal gills (setal blades), and a series of flaps on both sides that extended along the length of its body.\n\nAmplectobelua had a specialized frontal appendage, in which it has a distinct 3-segmented shaft region and 12-segmented distal articulated region, and the spine on the fourth segment (first segment of distal articulated region) hooked forward to oppose the tip of the appendage, allowing it to grasp prey like a pincer. Amplectobelua had 11 pairs of body flaps in total, they are relatively elongated and straight in outline. The size of the flaps decrease posteriory, and each of their frontal margin have rows of vein-like structures (strengthening rays).

They functioned like the gnathobases of arthropods, being able to rotate and move to shred prey. They were connected to reduced anterior flaps. Additionally, the mouth (oral cone) of Amplectobelua were interpreted as different from typical radiodont, lacking the typical Peytoia-style oral cone and possessing numerous flat tooth-plates with unclear, but possibly non-radial arrangement.\n\nTwo species are known, Amplectobelua\xa0symbrachiata from the Chengjiang biota and Amplectobelua\xa0stephenensis from the later Burgess Shale.

Some studies considered that name Amplectobelua trispinata should be used instead of A. symbrachiata.\n\nAmplectobelua was likely nektonic predator.

This animal is characterized by its long, forward facing head sclerite, and the endites on its frontal appendages that bore copious amounts of baleen-like auxiliary spines. This animal evolving filter-feeding traits was most likely a result of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, when environmental changes caused a diversification of plankton, which in turn allowed for the evolution of new suspension feeding lifeforms.

The quality of three-dimensional preservation has shed light on the nature of radiodont trunk flaps. Each trunk segment of the Aegirocassis benmoulai specimen has both a ventral and a dorsal pair of flaps. Several details seen clearly in the specimen led to a review and reassessment of research of existing specimens and, most importantly, to the conclusion that the ventral pair are homologous with arthropod endopods (limb-like inner branches) and lobopodian limbs (lobopods), and the dorsal pair are homologous with the flaps of gilled lobopodians and exites (gill-like outer branches) of the arthropod biramous limb. This discovery also found that other hurdiid radiodonts like Peytoia and Hurdia had a dorsal pair of flaps as well.\n\nFrontal appendages of Aegirocassis had five endites, and each endites had around 80 setae-like auxiliary spines. These spines are estimated to have been used as a mesh for filter feeding. It was probably able to consume mesozooplankton roughly the same size as the other filter feeding radiodont, Tamisiocaris, was able to catch. However, the spines on the frontal appendages of Aegirocassis are inward-angled, which allowed the spines to overlap to a degree, allowing more control over the size of the filtering mesh. This has led to the estimation that Aegirocassis may have fed on larger size ranges of zooplankton than Tamisiocaris could. In addition, the large carapace (H-element) may have helped to guide the feeding current to the frontal appendages. Eyes and mouthpart (oral cone) are not known from Aegirocassis.

In 2017, Galton and Ayyasami reported that the Bruhathkayosaurus fossils started to disintegrate inside their field jackets before reaching the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and no longer exist.\n\nBruhathkayosaurus was originally classified as a carnosaur (like Allosaurus), of an uncertain position (incertae sedis). However, Chatterjee (1995) re-examined the remains and demonstrated that Bruhathkayosaurus is actually a titanosaur sauropod. Some later studies listed Bruhathkayosaurus as an indeterminate sauropod or as a nomen dubium.\n\nThe original publication described little in the way of diagnostic characteristics and was only supported by a few line drawings and photographs of the fossils as they lay in the ground. This led to online speculation by researchers that the bones might actually have been petrified wood, akin to the way the original discoverers of Sauroposeidon initially believed their find to be fossilized tree trunks. A 2022 review by Pal and Ayyasami presented additional previously unseen photographs of the tibia bone at the excavation site and in a plaster jacket, and reinforced the taxon\'s position within Titanosauria. However, as Mohabey and colleagues noted in 2024, "this new information has not resolved the identity of the element nor the validity of the taxon."\n\nAccording to the published description, the shin bone (tibia) of Bruhathkayosaurus was 2\xa0m (6.6\xa0ft) long. This is 29\xa0percent larger than the fibula of Argentinosaurus, which is only 1.55\xa0m (5.1\xa0ft) long. The fragmentary femur was similarly huge; across the distal end, it measured 75\xa0cm (2.46\xa0ft), 33% larger than the femur of Antarctosaurus giganteus, which measures 56\xa0cm (1.84\xa0ft). The ilium measured 1.2\xa0m (3.9\xa0ft) in length.\n\nNo total body size estimates for Bruhathkayosaurus have been published, but paleontologists and researchers have posted tentative estimates on the Internet. In a post from June 2001, Mickey Mortimer estimated that Bruhathkayosaurus could have reached 44.1\xa0m (145\xa0ft) in length and might have weighed 175–220\xa0t (193–243 short tons), but in later posts retracted these estimates, reducing the estimated length to 28–47\xa0m (92–154\xa0ft) based on more complete titanosaurs (Saltasaurus, Opisthocoelicaudia and Rapetosaurus), and declined to provide a new weight estimate, describing the older weight estimates as inaccurate. In a May 2008 article for the weblog Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week, paleontologist Matt Wedel used a comparison with Argentinosaurus and calculated the weight of Bruhathkayosaurus at up to 126 metric tons (139 short tons). In 2019, Gregory S. Paul suggested that the supposed tibia was probably a degraded femur, in which case its length was slightly greater than that of Dreadnoughtus (1.91 meters) and Futalognkosaurus (1.98 meters). Its ilium is similar in length to that of Dreadnoughtus whereas the width of the distal femur appears to slightly exceed that of Patagotitan. Paul estimated its mass at around 30–55\xa0t (33–61 short tons), much lower than any previous estimation. In 2020, Molina-Perez and Larramendi suggested that the 2\xa0m (6.6\xa0ft) long tibia is probably a fibula, and estimated the size of the animal at 37\xa0m (121\xa0ft) and 95 metric tons (105 short tons).\n\nBy comparison, the titanosaur Argentinosaurus is estimated to have reached 35\xa0m (115\xa0ft) in length, and to have weighed 65–100 tonnes. These sauropods are known only from partial or fragmentary remains, so the size estimates are uncertain. Length is calculated by comparing existing bones to the bones of similar dinosaurs, which are known from more complete skeletons and scaling them up isometrically. However, such extrapolation can never be more than an educated guess and the length of the tail, in particular, is often hard to judge. Determining mass is even more difficult because little evidence of soft tissues survives in the fossil record. In addition, isometric scaling is based on the assumption that body proportions remain the same, which is not necessarily the case. In particular, the proportions of the titanosaurs are not well known, due to a limited number of relatively complete specimens.\n\nIf the upper size estimates for Bruhathkayosaurus are accurate, it would even rival the size of the largest recorded blue whale. Mature blue whales can reach 30\xa0m (98\xa0ft) in length, and the record-holder blue whale was recorded at 173 tonnes (190 short tons), with estimates of up to 199 tonnes (220 short tons).\n\nAnother poorly known sauropod that shares similar size estimates to Bruhathkayosaurus is Maraapunisaurus fragillimus, which is based on a now-missing dorsal vertebra. In 2006, Kenneth Carpenter used Diplodocus as a guide and estimated Maraapunisaurus to be 58\xa0m (190\xa0ft) in length and weigh only about 122.4 metric tons (130 short tons). In 2018, however, Carpenter estimated Maraapunisaurus to be 30–32\xa0m (98–105\xa0ft) in length based upon comparisons with rebbachisaurids. In 2019, Paul gave a higher estimation of 35 to 40 metres (115 to 131\xa0ft) and a weight of 80 to 120 tonnes (88 to 132 short tons).\n\nPaul and Larramendi (2023) suggested that Bruhathkayosaurus may have weighed within the range of 110–170 tonnes (120–190 short tons), though they stated that it would have likely weighed between 110 and 130 tonnes (120 and 140 short tons). Whilst its most liberal estimate was 240 tons when scaled with Patagotitan, they considered any estimate over 170 tonnes (190 short tons) to be unlikely. Nevertheless, Paul stressed that the idea of these \'super-sauropods\' or \'land-whales\' aren\'t as far-fetched as one would think given the long period of sauropod existence as well as their very efficient body-plan (i.e. small heads, large body, efficient ventilated air-sacs, strong and flexible muscle and bone structure, and large source of static food), indicating that the existence of 150+ ton sauropods such as Bruhathkayosaurus and Maraapunisaurus are in the realm of possibility.'], 'score': 5.3156576}, {'id': 'Calomyscus_bailwardi_grandis', 'name': ['Calomyscus bailwardi grandis'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe noble mouse-like hamster or the noble calomyscus, (Calomyscus grandis) is a species of mouse-like hamster from Iran.

The "Dr. Meller" to whom Gray dedicated this species was botanist Charles James Meller (1836-1869) who worked in the area that is now Malawi.\n\nT. melleri is relatively common in the bushy savannas and woodlands of East Africa where it can be found in Malawi, northern Mozambique, and Tanzania.\n\nThe largest of the chameleons from the African mainland, adult T. melleri generally are 30–61\xa0cm (12–24\xa0in) in total length and 300–500\xa0g (11–18\xa0oz) in weight, but exceptionally large individuals have reputedly been up to 76\xa0cm (30\xa0in) in length and 600\xa0g (21\xa0oz) in weight.\n\nFemales are generally smaller than males,  and have less developed dorsal and medial crests.  The head of this species is relatively small in relation to the rest of its body and has a more elongated shape in comparison to other chameleons in its genus.\n\nT. melleri is stout-bodied and has a relatively stubby tail one third the length of its body.  A low, scalloped crest extends from just behind the casque of the head through the proximal half of the tail, and a sharp medial crest runs from the lizard\'s eyes to the tip of its snout, which bears a single small horn.  This chameleon bears greatly enlarged occipital lobes.  It has heterogeneous scales which vary shape and size to various parts of its body and large, granular scales distributed homogeneously on the trunk and limbs.  There are longitudinal rows of large, granular scales in the chameleon\'s gular region, one of its most distinctive characteristics.\n\nSpots and broad vertical bands on the chameleon\'s flanks range in color from brown, dark green, yellow or even black.  The basic coloration of the creature is a deep forest green with white stripes, but like many chameleons it can change its color depending on various circumstances.  If being fed or handled they might display black and white dots.  When basking in the sun, the side of their body towards the sunlight can turn dark green or black, while the rest of the animal stays much lighter.\n\nMeller\'s chameleon has color patterns associated with stress.  Mild excitement or stress is indicated by dark spotting overlaying the reptile\'s normal color.  These dark green spots turn to black mottling as the chameleon gets more upset.  Severe stress turns the chameleon first charcoal gray, followed by pure white adorned with yellow stripes.  A sick Meller\'s chameleon may be mottled with brown, gray, pink, or white.  A gravid animal is black, cream, and gray colored and will be bulging with eggs.\n\nWith great care, T. melleri is one of the few species that can be housed in groups. This doesn\'t always work as some individuals will not get along. Constant observation is required to ensure the animals\' safety. Their long tongues can reach prey up to 20 inches (51\xa0cm) away.\n\nLike most chameleons, Meller\'s are strict carnivores eating insects, smaller lizards, spiders, crickets, worms, and caterpillars. Large specimens have been known to eat small birds.\n\nFemales annually produce a single clutch of up to 80 eggs.  Newborn Meller\'s chameleons are about 4 inches (10\xa0cm) in length and must be fed Drosophilidae and tiny crickets for the first three weeks of their lives.  Afterwards, they accept house flies and larger insect prey including crickets, locusts, silkworms, and cockroaches.  They may live as long as twelve years.\n\nT. melleri specimens vary from timid to moderately aggressive towards humans, with some specimens being reported as friendly.

One breeder recommends placing the chameleon\'s cage  above human eye level so that it can feel elevated in its environment.\n\nHigh day time temperatures (80-85\xa0°F or 27-29\xa0°C) are needed for the reptile\'s enclosure.

He placed it in the stork genus Ciconia and coined the binomial name Ciconia crumenifera. He specified that locality as Senegal. The species epithet means "carrying a purse around the neck". The species is now placed with the lesser adjutant and the greater adjutant in the genus Leptoptilos that Lesson had introduced at the same time he described the marabou stork. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.\n\nThe common name marabou is thought to be derived from the Arabic word murābit meaning quiet or hermit-like. The species was originally described as Ciconia crumenifera. When the species was moved into the genus Leptoptilos, the ending was modified to crumeniferus and this was used by many authors until it was noted that the correct masculine ending to match the genus is crumenifer.\n\nThe marabou stork is a massive bird: large specimens are thought to reach a height of 152 centimetres (5 feet) and a weight of 9\xa0kg (20\xa0lb). A wingspan of 3.7\xa0m (12\xa0ft) was accepted by Fisher and Peterson, who ranked the species as having the largest wing-spread of any living bird. Even higher measurements of up to 4.06\xa0m (13.3\xa0ft) have been reported, although no measurement over 3.20\xa0m (10.5\xa0ft) has been verified.[citation needed] It is often credited with the largest spread of any landbird, to rival the Andean condor; more typically, however, these storks measure 225–287\xa0cm (7–9\xa0ft) across the wings, which is about a foot less than the average Andean condor wingspan and nearly two feet less than the average of the largest albatrosses and pelicans. Typical weight is 4.5–8\xa0kg (10–17.5\xa0lb), unusually as low as 4\xa0kg (9\xa0lb), and length (from bill to tail) is 120 to 130\xa0cm (47 to 51\xa0in). Females are smaller than males. Bill length can range from 26.4 to 35\xa0cm (10.5 to 14\xa0in). Unlike most storks, the three Leptoptilos species fly with the neck retracted like a heron.\n\nThe marabou is unmistakable due to its size, bare head and neck, black back, and white underparts. It has a huge bill, a pink gular sac at its throat (crumenifer(us) means "carrier of a pouch for money"), a neck ruff, and white legs and black wings. The sexes are alike, but the young bird is browner and has a smaller bill. Full maturity is not reached for up to four years.\n\nLike most storks, the marabou is gregarious and a colonial breeder. In the African dry season (when food is more readily available as the pools shrink), it builds a tree nest in which two or three eggs are laid. It is known to be quite ill-tempered.\n\nIt also resembles other storks in that it is not very vocal, but indulges in bill-rattling courtship displays. The throat sac is also used to make various noises at that time.\n\nThe marabou stork breeds in Africa south of the Sahara. In East Africa, the birds interact with humans and breed in urban areas. In southern African countries, the birds breed mainly in less populated areas. The marabou stork breeds in colonies, starting during the dry season. The female lays two to three eggs in a small nest made of sticks; eggs hatch after an incubation period of 30 days. Their young reach sexual maturity at 4 years of age. Lifespan is 43 years in captivity and 25 years in wild.\n\nThe marabou stork is a frequent scavenger, and the naked head and long neck are adaptations to this livelihood, as it is with the vultures with which the stork often feeds. In both cases, a feathered head would become rapidly clotted with blood and other substances when the bird\'s head was inside a large corpse, and the bare head is easier to keep clean.[citation needed]\n\nThis large and powerful bird eats mainly carrion, scraps, and faeces but will opportunistically eat almost any animal matter it can swallow. It occasionally eats other birds including Quelea nestlings, pigeons, doves, pelican and cormorant chicks, and even flamingos. During the breeding season, adults scale back on carrion and take mostly small, live prey since nestlings need this kind of food to survive. Common prey at this time may consist of fish, frogs, insects, eggs, small mammals and reptiles such as crocodile hatchlings and eggs, and lizards and snakes. Though known to eat putrid and seemingly inedible foods, these storks may sometimes wash food in water to remove soil.\n\nWhen feeding on carrion, marabou frequently follow vultures, which are better equipped with hooked bills for tearing through carrion meat and may wait for the vultures to cast aside a piece, steal a piece of meat directly from the vulture or wait until the vultures are done. As with vultures, marabou storks perform an important natural function by cleaning areas via their ingestion of carrion and waste.\n\nIncreasingly, marabous have become dependent on human garbage and hundreds of the huge birds can be found around African dumps or waiting for a hand out in urban areas. Marabous eating human garbage have been seen to devour virtually anything that they can swallow, including shoes and pieces of metal. Marabous conditioned to eating from human sources have been known to lash out when refused food.\n\nFully grown marabou storks have few natural enemies, and have high annual survival rate, though lions have reportedly preyed on some individuals in ambush. A number of endoparasites have been identified in wild marabous including Cheilospirura, Echinura and Acuaria nematodes, Amoebotaenia sphenoides (Cestoda) and Dicrocoelium hospes (Trematoda).\n\nMarabou down is frequently used in the trimming of various items of clothing and hats, as well as fishing lures.

The emerald green becomes black several months after shedding. As a young tegu, the tail is banded yellow and black; as it ages, the solid yellow bands nearest to the body change to areas of weak speckling. Fewer solid bands indicates an older animal. A tegu can drop a section of its tail as a distraction if attacked. The tail is also used as a weapon to swipe at an aggressor; even a half-hearted swipe can leave a bruise.[citation needed] The tegu can live up to twenty years. \n\nTegus are capable of running at high speeds and can run bipedally for short distances. They often use this method in territorial defense, with the mouth open and front legs held wide to look more threatening.[citation needed]\n\nAdult males are much larger than the females and can reach 3 feet (91\xa0cm) in length at maturity.

Biomechanical analyses suggest the posterior processes of the parietal might be important for dealing with torsional loads due to posterior biting on one side. In the large adults, the posterior teeth are larger and more rounded than the anterior teeth.\n\nWhen a tegu reaches the age of 8 months, the beginning of their juvenile age, their sex can easily be determined visually; their vent at the base of the tail will bulge when it is a male and lie flat when it is a female. Breeders generally inform the buyer on the sex of the animal before the purchase. In adults, the main difference is in the jowls; adult males have substantially developed jowls (a result of hypertrophic lateral pterygoideus muscles), while females\' jawlines are more streamlined.[citation needed]\n\nAs the name would suggest, this tegu is native to Argentina, but also to Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay.\n\nSalvator merianae (once known as Tupinambis merianae), the Argentine black and white tegu, is a large reptile native to South America. There are significant populations of Argentine black and white tegus in the southern United States and the Brazilian coast. They are a consistently problematic invasive species in Florida and Georgia counties, along with sightings in South Carolina, most likely as a result of escaped or released species from the early 2000s pet trade. Previous studies have found that the differing weather and climate patterns far outside of their natural habitat range do not prevent adult Argentine black and white tegus from surviving in diverse areas across the United States, furthering concerns about their invasive status. In the wild, tegus inhabit both forested and open plain environments, widening their potential invasive range. The first evidence of a reproducing population of Argentine Black and White Tegus into southeastern Florida occurred when a female Argentine Black and White Tegu was tracked to her nest mound. One clutch of 21 eggs from the current year was found and one clutch of 22 hatched eggshells and 13 unhatched eggs was found from a past year. Established communities were identified in Hillsborough and Polk counties in Florida.\n\nTegus have also been found in scrub and wet habitats such as flooded savannas, canals, ponds, and streams. They largely seem indiscriminate of habitat type as long as they have the ability to burrow.\n\nTegus are omnivorous. Juvenile tegus in the wild have been observed to eat a wide range of invertebrates including insects, annelids, crustaceans, spiders and snails. They also eat fruits and seeds. As they mature, their diet becomes more generalized, and plant consumption increases. They may seek out eggs from the nests of birds and other reptiles, and will eat small birds and other vertebrates such as fish, frogs, other lizards, snakes and small mammals (such as rodents). They can also hunt larger prey such as armadillos.[citation needed] In adulthood, tegus continue to eat insects and wild fruits and it is assumed that such components include desirable or essential nutrients.\n\nIn captivity, tegus commonly are fed high protein diets that include raw or cooked flesh such as ground turkey, canned and dry dog food, commercial crocodile diet, chicken, eggs, insects and small rodents. The inclusion of fruit in the diet is recommended. Though some captive tegus do not readily eat fruit, others enjoy bananas, grapes, mangoes and papayas. However, there is evidence that, as in most husbandry of carnivores, it is good practice to cook most of the egg in the diet, so as to denature the protein avidin that occurs in the albumen. Raw avidin immobilises biotin, so excessive feeding of raw eggs may cause fatal biotin deficiency.\n\nAs adults, they have blunted teeth and exaggerated lateral pterygoid muscles which allow them to be generalist feeders. In captivity, they have been observed eating various feeder insects like mealworms, superworms, earthworms, silkworms, crickets and cockroaches, as well as vertebrate prey like mice, rats, fish, turkey (offered in a ground form), rabbit, quail and chicks. Crustaceans such as crayfish are also readily consumed. Like all lizards, blue tegus need a properly balanced diet; incomplete prey items such as insects or ground meat require dusting with a mineral/multi-vitamin supplement. Vitamin deficiencies can lead to trouble shedding skin, lethargy and weight loss; a calcium deficiency can lead to metabolic bone disease, which can be fatal.\n\nTegus are notorious egg predators which makes them a concerning rising predator of sea turtles, alligators, and crocodiles as their invasive populations spread across the United States.\n\nTegus will eat anything from plants to hatchlings, but their diet varies by season. Small vertebrate prey is more common in the spring while plant life and invertebrates are more commonly consumed in the summer.\n\nPredators of tegus include cougars, jaguars, otters, snakes, caimans, and birds of prey. A known predator of the Argentine black and white tegu is the lesser grison (Galictis cuja), a mustelid related to weasels. Salmonella enterica was found in fecal samples from almost all S. merianae at a captive breeding field station at State University of Santa Cruz, Ilhéus, Bahia state, Brazil illustrating the prevalence of salmonella infection in tegu lizards.\n\nArgentine black and white tegu lizards are typically hatched at the beginning of spring. When they hatch they are about ten grams and grow up to eight kilograms within four or five years, experiencing a nearly eight-hundred-fold increase in body size. During this time their diet changes from insects to small vertebrates, eggs, carrion, and fruits. They are reproductively mature by their third year (when they are around 1.5 kilograms), and cease their growth by around their fourth year with the highest growth rate being their first and second years of life. Tegu lizards also experience a seasonal life cycle that begins within their first year, being very active during hotter months and in a hibernative state in the colder months. However, regardless of the season the Argentine tegu does not experience any significant fluctuations in metabolism or body mass, which means their sensitivity to temperature underlying their metabolic rate does not change body mass. This differs from other endotherms and further explains the tegu\'s alternating endothermic and ectothermic behavior.\n\nBrain vesicles (constructed from two neural tube constrictions) that make up the anterior forebrain, midbrain, and posterior hindbrain are developed and distinguishable from day three of embryonic development. On day four, visceral arches (consisting of mesenchymal tissue condensation and separated by grooves) form and are fully grown and fused by day nine. Day four also marks the development of limbs as small swellings. Its hindlimb development (developing claws faster than the forelimb) is more similar to crocodile or turtle embryonic development than other lizards. This alludes to the hindlimbs having greater functionality in tegu adults. Pigmentation is the last morphological structure to form and occurs late in development after other distinguishing characteristics have already been formed (such as scales). Pigmentation is observed from day thirty-nine first on the dorsal portion of the head and body. It later extends down to the proximal and distal portions of the limbs by day forty-five and extends down to the flanks by day forty-eight. As development advances, the pattern begins to show lateral stretch marks by day fifty-one. Pigmentation of the ventral portion of the body occurs between days fifty-seven and sixty, characterized by individualized spot patterns. Paired genital tubercles manifest in both sexes (called hemipenes in males). Reptile embryo development involves separate processes of differentiation and embryo growth. Differentiation is determined by external morphological features and is documented early. As the embryo approaches hatching, development stages are categorized into periods rather than ages (characterized by parameters of development speed).\n\nAggression is a vital facet to animal behavior as it provides advantages to survival when resources are limited. For the Argentine tegu, the physical performance of their aggressive behavior (i.e. biting) tends to be hindered by their large size. Regardless of sex, tegus with higher bite force are more aggressive to potential threats. Those with a higher bite force also exhibit less escape responses and tend to be slower, displaying a trade off of fight or flight abilities, but also have the advantage of minimizing risk of energy by reducing the threshold for engagement in an aggressive encounter. This fight or flight trade off is more commonly observed in mammals rather than reptiles, and may be present in tegus because of an increase in head mass (correlated to stronger biting behavior) that makes it difficult to maneuver quickly. In their home territory, Argentine tegus are generally less aggressive (less likely to display arching behavior) and are less likely to attempt escape regardless of size or bite force.\n\nSquamate reptiles like snakes and lizards tend to rely on chemical cues to search for potential mates in their environments. A study using skin lipids indicates chemical cues can be used to modify movements of invasive reptiles in their non-native range, which could be useful in management strategies. The Argentine black and white tegu exhibits similar behavior, such as a marked "pausing and turning" as they trail in the spring. In particular, female tegus exhibit stronger trailing behavior than males, following scent trails more intensely and expressing a more sensitive response to mating-specific chemical odors. They also exhibit more decisive behavior, demonstrating a common vertebrate trend of female reproduction being the defining factor in influencing population size. Knowledge of this behavior is currently being explored as a strategic avenue to inhibit the current rise of the tegu as an invasive species. Prioritizing the removal of female tegus from the environment can potentially be a more effective way to curb these invasive populations. Tegus are a burrowing species in both their native and invasive habitats, especially during the winter. They mate during the spring after hibernating when their mating hormones are at their peak. During the spring, male Argentine tegus exhibit scent-marking behaviors such as delineating territory with gland scents.\n\nBlue tegus, like other tegus, may breed up to twice a year. They only lay between 18 and 25 eggs in a clutch, sometimes more dependent upon animal size and husbandry as well as the individual health of the gravid female.[citation needed]\n\nDuring maternal seasons, female Argentine black and white tegus build nests out of dry grass, small branches, and leaves in order to maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels. Egg incubation lasts for an average of sixty-four days, with a range of forty to seventy-five days depending on incubation temperature and other extenuating factors.\n\nPhysiologically, tegus possess traits that correlate well with their extreme success as an invasive species. Notably, they mature early, reproduce annually, have large clutch sizes, and a relatively long life span compared to other competing species. Out of the Teiidae family, tegus tend to grow to the largest body sizes (around five kilograms). Tegus are also omnivorous and consume everything from fruits, invertebrates, small vertebrates, eggs, and carrion. Their large dietary breadth also contributes to their high survival rate outside of their native habitat. Tegus are active on a seasonal schedule. They avoid dangerously cold or dry climates by hibernating underground. Additionally, they are capable of utilizing endothermy to elevate their body temperatures in response to their environment.\n\nTegus in their native environment spend most of the colder months hibernating in their burrows without feeding but emerge in the spring for their mating season. While hibernating, their metabolism generates heat that maintains their temperature a few degrees above the burrow temperature, marking them as partial endotherms. This self-reliant endothermic behavior continues into the reproductive season. However, Argentine tegus only display this behavior for part of the year and behave as ectotherms for the rest (sunbathing, temperature reliant on environment). This endothermic behavior is also not a sex-biased evolutionary adaptation for egg production as both males and females indiscriminately exhibit this behavior.\n\nThe Argentine tegu experiences significant shifts in metabolism and body temperature by season. They are highly active throughout the day during warmer months (such as participating in reproductive endothermy during the spring) and experience drastic metabolic suppression during the winter.\n\nSalvator merianae has recently been shown to be one of the few partially warm-blooded lizards, having a temperature up to 10\xa0°C (18\xa0°F) higher than the ambient temperature at nighttime; however, unlike true endotherms such as mammals and birds, these lizards only display temperature control during their reproductive season (September to December), so are said to possess seasonal reproductive endothermy. Because convergent evolution is one of the strongest lines of evidence for the adaptive significance of a trait, the discovery of reproductive endothermy in this lizard not only complements the long known reproductive endothermy observed in some species of pythons, but also supports the hypothesis that the initial selective benefit for endothermy in birds and mammals was reproductive.\n\nThe Argentine black and white tegu is used to study the evolutionary history of shoulder joint locomotive muscles. Because of its weight and heavy girth, it has unique modifications to its skeletal gait that help map the evolutionary history of the non-mammalian musculoskeletal structure.\n\nWhen black and white tegu are kept as pets, they can be fed proteins, fruits, and vegetables. Some examples of proteins that they can be fed are live bugs such as meal and horn worms, dubia roaches, and crickets. Other sources of protein include canned insects, scrambled or hard boiled eggs, snails, ducklings, chicks, boiled organ meats, shrimp, mice, or rats that are either alive or have been previously frozen and then thawed. The black and white tegu may be fed fruits and vegetables as well. For example, they can be fed berries such as strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. They can also be fed bananas, apples, kiwis, pears, pumpkins, melons, peas, squash, apricots, mangos, figs, papaya, cantaloupe, and grapes.\n\nThe blue tegu is a variant known for its light blue coloration, which is most intense and vivid in the adult males. Even immature animals can be easily distinguished from other tegus – mostly black and white – by the "singe mark" on their nose. They are among the more suitable tegus for pets and can be easily tamed but, in the wild, will either try to run away or react aggressively if provoked.\n\nThe scientific classification of the blue tegu is contentious. Large-scale taxon sampling of the teiids has not led to any strong resolutions based on morphological and genetic data; the majority of data about the blue tegu comes from hobbyists. Some believe it is a mutation of the Argentine black and white tegu, while others, including the original importer, believe it is sufficiently different to classified as its own species, or a subspecies. The first blue tegu to be exported from South America was in a wholesale shipment of tegus from Colombia.\n\nThe coloring of a "blue" tegu can range from a simple black and white color, to albino, to powder blue, to even \'platinum\' (which is basically a high white color morph). The distinct colouration does not tend to appear until the animal reaches sexual maturity, around the age of 18\xa0months or it reaches 2 feet (61\xa0cm) or more in size. Just like the Argentine black and white tegu, the blue tegu has a very quick growth rate, almost reaching 75% of its full length in 1\xa0year. Their adult length can vary from 2.5 feet (76\xa0cm), in adult females, to sometimes even longer than 4 feet (122\xa0cm) in adult males. Unlike many other lizards, tegus are very heavily built animals, ranging from 7 to 12 pounds (3.2 to 5.4\xa0kg) or more when fully grown. Size varies due to genetics, husbandry (if any), and diet.\n\nOn May 28, 2021 the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources banned importation and breeding, and requires registration of black and white tegus already in South Carolina.\n\nS. merianae – like a lot of other animals used for bushmeat – is a common food source for humans in its native range. It could be an economically and dietarily beneficial meat source if used more widely.\n\nThe Argentine black and white tegu has long been hunted for their skins to supply the international leather trade. They are one of the most exploited reptile species in the world, but trade is legal in most South American countries. It is not an endangered species and overharvesting has not as of yet been observed.\n\nIn Florida Argentine black and white tegus have escaped from the pet trade and are now an invasive species in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The first sighting of S.\xa0merianae in Berkeley County, South Carolina was on 10\xa0September 2020. Eight total sightings in South Carolina had been recorded as of 10\xa0September 2020.\n\nThe Argentine black and white tegu has been a particular threat to native birds and reptiles that build nests or burrows on the ground. Notably, they exhibit a particular type of both predatory and competitive behavior known as intraguild predation, which worsens their invasive effect on wildlife: Argentine tegus will pursue and kill – but not eat – other native reptiles. Efforts such as placing traps or local hunting have been largely unsuccessful in reducing their bad effects in the non-native environments.\n\nBecause of their invasive threat to native and imperiled species, population containment initiatives have been a priority in the past ten years, leading to the extraction of nearly 3,300\xa0tegus from Miami-Dade County alone. Unfortunately tegu culling efforts have had little effect: Historically, tegus survived brutal leather-trade harvests in their native environment, demonstrating that they are a remarkably resilient species.\n\nAs of 29 April 2021, residents of Florida are now legally allowed to kill these invasive Argentine black and white tegus that are spotted on private property, with the landowners\' permission, and on the public lands of Florida. Legal barriers that had been protecting the non-native reptiles have been removed, to prevent the population of tegus from increasing in Florida. As an alternative to killing them, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) staff offer to take control and maintain this species by capturing and removing tegus from the environment.\n\nIn 1839, this species of tegu was originally described as Salvator merianae. However, beginning in 1845 and continuing for 154 years, it was confused with Tupinambis teguixin and was considered a synonym of that species. In 1995, it was again given species status as Tupinambis merianae because subsequent studies had shown that the gold tegu (Tupinambis teguixin) was distinct from it. In 2012, the Argentine black and white tegu was reassigned to the resurrected genus Salvator as Salvator merianae.\n\nS. merianae is called the "Argentine black and white tegu" to distinguish it from the "Colombian black and white tegu", which is another name for the gold tegu. Unscrupulous or incompetent pet dealers sometimes pass off gold tegus as Argentine black and white tegus.[citation needed]\n\nS. merianae and T. teguixin can be distinguished by skin texture and scale count:\n\nIn the ecotone between the arid Chaco and the Espinal of central Argentina, they are known to naturally hybridise with the red tegu (Salvator rufescens) with a stable hybrid zone.'], 'score': 5.1151686}, {'id': 'Phyllobates_terribilis', 'name': ['Phyllobates terribilis'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), also known as the golden dart frog or golden poison arrow frog, is a poison dart frog endemic from the rainforests of Colombia. The golden poison frog has become endangered due to habitat destruction within its naturally limited range. Despite its small size, this frog is considered to be the most poisonous extant animal species on the planet.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The golden poison frog was described as Phyllobates terribilis in 1978 by herpetologists Charles W. Myers and Borys Malkin as well as biochemist John W. Daly; the species name terribilis is a reference to the deadly toxins present in the skin secretions of this species. Myers\' research was based on hundreds of specimens collected on an expedition to the Quebrada Guangui and La Brea regions of the Colombian rainforest, and a breeding colony of 18 frogs established at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe golden poison frog is endemic to humid forests of the Pacific coast of Colombia in the Cauca and Valle del Cauca Departments in the Chocó Rainforest.  The optimal habitat of this species is the rainforest with high rain rates (5\xa0m or more per year), altitudes from sea level to 200\xa0m elevation, temperatures of at least 26\xa0°C, and relative humidity of 80–90%.[citation needed] It is known only from primary forest. The eggs are laid on the ground; the males transport the tadpoles to permanent pools. Its range is less than 5,000 square km; destruction of this habitat has contributed to P. terribilis becoming an endangered species.\n\nThe golden poison frog is the largest species of the poison dart frog family, and can reach a weight of nearly 30 grams with a length of 6\xa0cm as adults. Females are typically larger than males. The adults are brightly colored, while juvenile frogs have mostly black bodies with two golden-yellow stripes along their backs. The black fades as they mature, and at around 18 weeks of age the frog is fully colored. The frog\'s color pattern is aposematic (a coloration to warn predators of its toxicity). Despite their common name, golden poison frogs occur in four main color varieties or morphs:\n\nThe yellow morph is the reason Phyllobates terribilis has the common name golden poison frog. These frogs can be pale yellow to deep, golden yellow in color. Yellow Phyllobates terribilis specimens are found in Quebrada Guangui, Colombia.\n\nThe largest morph of Phyllobates terribilis exists in the La Brea and La Sirpa areas in Colombia; despite the name "mint green" these frogs can be metallic green, pale green, or white.\n\nOrange examples of Phyllobates terribilis exist in Colombia, as well. They tend to be a metallic orange or yellow-orange in color, with varying intensity. They have been observed living near yellow specimens in Quebrada Guangui, Colombia, and it is unclear to what extent these represent an individual subpopulation or locality distinct from the yellow morph.\n\nThe orange blackfoot morph is a captive bred line established by Tesoros de Colombia, a Colombian company that aims to reduce poaching of wild dart frogs by breeding rare species and flooding the pet trade with low cost animals to decrease the value of wild specimens to poachers.  This morph is golden yellow to a deep orange. They have dark markings on their feet, throat, vent, and rump that range from distinct black to nearly absent or speckled grey.\n\nThe frog is normally diurnal; golden poison frogs live evenly spaced without forming larger congregations.\n\nThis species is an unspecialized ambush hunter; an adult frog can eat food items much larger in relation to its size than most other dendrobatids. The main natural sources of food of P. terribilis are the ants in the genera Brachymyrmex and Paratrechina, but many kinds of insects and other small invertebrates can be eaten, specifically termites and beetles, which can easily be found on the rainforest floor.[citation needed] Tadpoles feed on algae, mosquito larvae, and other edible material that may be present in their environment.[citation needed]\n\nMales advertise to receptive females with a trilling call.[citation needed] Golden poison frogs are notable for demonstrating tactile courtship during reproduction, each partner stroking its mate\'s head, back, flanks, and cloacal areas prior to egg deposition. The eggs are fertilized externally. The golden poison frogs lay their eggs on the ground, hidden beneath leaf litter. Once the tadpoles emerge from their eggs, they stick themselves to the mucus on the backs of their parents. The adult frogs carry their young into the canopy, depositing them in the pools of water that accumulate in the centre of bromeliads and water-filled tree holes. The tadpoles feed on algae and mosquito larvae in their nursery.\n\nGolden poison frogs are so toxic that adult frogs likely have few – if any – predators. The snake species Leimadophis epinephelus has shown resistance to several frog toxins including batrachotoxin, and has been observed to eat juvenile frogs without ill effects.\n\nThe golden poison frog is one of the most poisonous animals on the planet; these frogs produce deadly alkaloid batrachotoxins in their skin glands as a defense against predators.  To become poisoned a predator generally must attempt to consume the frog, although this species is so toxic that even touching an individual frog can be dangerous. [failed verification] This extraordinarily lethal poison is very rare. Batrachotoxin is found only in three poisonous frogs from Colombia (all genus Phyllobates), a few birds from Papua New Guinea, and four Papuan beetles of the genus Choresine in the family Melyridae. Batrachotoxin affects the sodium channels of nerve cells. While it is unknown how the frog avoids poisoning itself, other species of poisonous frogs have been demonstrated to express a "toxin sponge" protein in blood plasma, internal organs, and muscle that binds and sequesters the toxin so as to prevent autointoxication.\n\nBatrachotoxin binds to, and irreversibly opens, the sodium channels of nerve cells leaving the muscles in an inactive state of contraction, which can lead to paralysis, heart fibrillation, heart failure, and death. The average dose carried will vary between locations, and consequent local diet, but the average wild golden poison frog is generally estimated to contain about one milligram of poison, enough to kill between 10 and 20 humans, or up to two African bull elephants. Smaller doses have been shown to cause seizures, salivation, muscle contractions, dyspnoea and death in mice: the subcutaneous LD50 is just 0.2\xa0μg/kg, although low doses such as 0.01\xa0μg/kg and 0.02\xa0μg/kg may be lethal. Myers et al. estimate that the lethal dose for humans is between 2.0 and 7.5\xa0μg.\n\nGolden poison frogs appear to rely on the consumption of small insects or other arthropods to synthesize batrachotoxin; frogs kept in captivity fed on commercially available feeder insects will eventually lose their toxicity, and frogs bred in captivity are considered non-toxic. It is not clear which prey species supplies the potent alkaloid that gives golden poison frogs their exceptionally high levels of toxicity, or whether the frogs modify another available toxin to produce a more efficient variant, as do some of the frogs from the genus Dendrobates. Scientists have suggested the crucial prey item may be a small beetle from the family Melyridae. At least one species of these beetles produces the same toxin found in golden poison frogs. Their relatives in Colombian rainforests could be the source of the batrachotoxins found in the highly toxic Phyllobates frogs of that region.\n\nGolden poison frogs are a very important frog to the local indigenous cultures, such as the Emberá and Cofán people in Colombia\'s rainforest. The frog is the main source of the poison in the darts used by the natives to hunt their food. The Emberá people carefully expose the frog to the heat of a fire, and the frog exudes small amounts of poisonous fluid.  The tips of arrows and darts are soaked in the fluid, and remain deadly for two years or longer.\n\nThe golden poison frog is a popular vivarium subject due to its bright color and bold personality in captivity. Despite its dangerous toxicity in the wild, captive specimens raised without their natural food sources are non-toxic in captivity. Due to their small range in the wild, poaching for the pet trade formerly represented a serious threat to the survival of the species. Due to efforts of frog breeders like Tesoros de Colombia, captive bred frogs are now widely available for the pet trade. As these specimens are legal, non-toxic, healthier, and less expensive when compared to poached animals, the demand for illegally obtained wild caught specimens has decreased. Today, the IUCN estimates that the majority of golden poison frogs sold for the pet trade are legally produced from captive lines, and estimates the threat from collection for the pet trade to be small.'], 'score': 5.1066895}, {'id': 'Cervus_canadensis_songaricus', 'name': ['Cervus canadensis songaricus'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe Tian Shan wapiti or Tian Shan maral (Cervus canadensis songaricus), is a subspecies of C. canadensis.

It is the animal from which the subfamily Machairodontinae gets its name and has since become a wastebasket taxon over the years as many genera of sabertooth cat have been and are still occasionally lumped into it."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['Machairodus was first named in 1832, by German Naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. Though its remains had been known since 1824, it was believed by Georges Cuvier that the fossils had come from a species of bear, which he called Ursus cultridens (known today as Megantereon) based on composite sample of teeth from different countries, species and geologic ages, leading to what would become a long series of complications. Kaup however, recognized the teeth as those of felids and promptly reclassified the existing specimens as Machairodus, including M. cultridens in it. The name quickly gained acceptance and by the end of the 19th century, many species of felid or related feliform (such as nimravids) were lumped into the genus Machairodus, including but not limited to Sansanosmilus, Megantereon, Paramachairodus, Amphimachairodus, Nimravides, and Homotherium among others. This would eventually turn Machairodus into something of a wastebasket taxon, which would be rectified with the discoveries of more complete skeletons of other machairodonts.\n\nIn general Machairodus was similar in size to a modern lion or tiger, at 2\xa0m (6.6 feet) long and standing about 1\xa0m (3.3 feet) at the shoulder.\n\nM. aphanistus from the Mediterranean late Miocene is known to be rather tiger-like in size and skeletal proportions, with a mass of 100\xa0kg (220 pounds) to 240\xa0kg (530 pounds). It was similar to the related Nimravides of North America. The skeleton also indicates that this species would have possessed good jumping abilities.\n\nM. alberdiae was contemporary with M. aphanistus in Cerro de los Batallones fossil deposits and  was smaller and more primitive in anatomical features and would not have exceeded 100\xa0kg (220 pounds).\n\nM. horribilis of China is one of largest known species in the genus, weighing around 405\xa0kg (893 pounds). This is comparable in size to the much later Smilodon populator. Its skull, measuring upwards of 16 inches (41\xa0cm) in length, is one of the largest known skulls for any machairodont, with only a recently described S. populator skull rivaling it in size, with the latter cat outweighing M. horribilis at 960\xa0lb (440\xa0kg).\n\nThe species M. lahayishupup of North America was also quite large; fossil humerus bones measuring 18\xa0in (46\xa0cm) attributed to the species suggest that this cat was far larger than a modern lion, which has a 13\xa0in (33\xa0cm) humerus. It is estimated to have weighed between 241 and 348\xa0kg, with a mean weight of 277\xa0kg; one particularly large specimen was estimated to weigh 410\xa0kg. Until its discovery, no true species representative of the genus Machairodus had been described from North America, as they had been reassigned to other genera, such as Nimravides and Amphimachairodus. Its presence in North America suggests that either there was a widespread population of this genus of cat throughout Africa, Eurasia and North America or simultaneous instances of independent evolution in machairodonts on multiple continents during the Miocene.\n\nOverall, the skull of Machairodus was noticeably narrow compared with the skulls of extant pantherine cats, and the orbits were relatively small. The canines were long, thin and flattened from side to side but broad from front to back like the blade of a knife, as in Homotherium. The front and back edges of the canines were serrated when they first grew, but these serrations were worn down in the first few years of the animal\'s life. However, a skull of M. horribilis was shown to be similar to extant pantherines in some cranial characters, suggesting new evidence for the diversity of killing bites even in the largest saber-toothed carnivorans, offering an additional mechanism for the mosaic evolution leading to functional and morphological diversity in sabertooth cats.\n\nMachairodus probably hunted as an ambush predator. Its legs were too short to sustain a long chase, so it most likely was a good jumper, and used its canines to cut open the throat of its prey. Its teeth were rooted to its mouth and were as delicate as those in some related genera, unlike most saber-toothed cats and nimravids of the time, which often had extremely long canines which hung out of their mouths. The fangs of Machairodus, however, were able to more easily fit in its mouth comfortably while being long and effective for hunting. Despite its great size, the largest example of Machairodus, M. horribilis was better equipped to hunt relatively smaller prey than Smilodon, as evidenced by its moderate jaw gape of 70 degrees, similar to the gape of a modern lion.\n\nThe fossil species assigned to the genus Machairodus were divided by Turner into two grades of evolutionary development, with M. aphanistus and the North American "Nimravides" catacopis representing the more primitive grade and M. coloradensis and M. giganteus representing the more derived grade. The characteristics of the more advanced grade include a relative elongation of the forearm and a shortening of the lumbar region of the spine to resemble that in living pantherine cats. Subsequently, the more derived forms were assigned a new genus, Amphimachairodus, which includes M. coloradensis, M. kurteni, M. kabir and M. giganteus. In addition, M. catacopsis was reclassified as N. catacopsis.\n\nStudies of Machairodus indicate that the cat relied predominantly on its neck muscles to make the killing bite applied to its victims. The cervical vertebrae show clear adaptations to making vertical motions in the neck and skull. There are also clear adaptations for precise movements, strength, and flexibility in the neck that show compatibility with the canine-shearing bite technique that machairodontine cats are believed to have performed. These adaptations are believed to have also been partial compensation in this primitive machairodont against the high percentage of canine breakages seen in the genus.\n\nMachairodus seemed to prefer open woodland habitat, as evidenced by finds at Cerro de los Batallones, which is of Vallesian age. As a top predator at Batallones, it would have hunted large herbivores of the time. Such herbivores would have included horses like Hipparion, the hornless rhinoceros Aceratherium, the giraffes Decennatherium and Birgerbohlinia, the deer Euprox and Lucentia, the antelopes Paleoreas, Tragoportax, Miotragocerus and Dorcatherium, the “gomphotherid” elephantoid Tetralophodon, the porcupine Hystrix, and the suid Microstonyx. Machairodus would have competed for such prey with the Amphicyonid Magericyon, fellow machairodonts Promegantereon and Paramachairodus, bears such as Agriotherium and Indarctos, and the small hyaenid Protictitherium. While Agriotherium and Magericyon would likely have been strongly competitive with Machairodus for food, Promegantereon, Paramachairodus and Protictitherium likely were less potential rivals. Evidence also exists indicating that Machairodus may have been prone to niche partitioning with Magericyon, possibly living in slightly different habitats, with the machairodont preferring more heavily vegetated habitats while the bear-dog hunted in the more open areas. Dietary preferences may also have played a role in the coexistence between these two large predators at Batallones.\n\nBased on its jaw gape, the largest species, M. horribilis was probably a hunter of relatively slow-moving horses of the genus Hipparion. It would have also lived alongside the large pig Kubanochoerus.\nM. lahayishupup would have most likely preyed on the large animals that it lived alongside, which included rhinoceroses, and Hemiauchenia.\n\nMachairodus aphanistus fossils recovered from Batallones reveal a high percentage of tooth breakages, indicating that unlike later machairodonts, due to a lack of protruding incisors Machairodus often used its sabers to subdue prey in a manner similar to modern cats; this was a more risky strategy that virtually ensured that damage to their saber teeth often occurred. M. aphanistus fossils from Batallones displaying palaeopathologies also include a calcaneus displaying evidence of either a tumour or osteomyelitis, a third metacarpal displaying signs of osteosclerosis, and a mandible with an abscess in the mandibular body.'], 'score': 5.0511017}, {'id': 'Aegypius_monachus', 'name': ['Aegypius monachus'], 'introduction': ["\n\nVultur monachus Linnaeus,\xa01766\n\nThe cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) is a large raptor in the family Accipitridae and distributed through much of temperate Eurasia. It is also known as the black vulture, monk vulture and Eurasian black vulture. With a body length of 1.2\xa0m (3\xa0ft 11\xa0in), 3.1\xa0m (10\xa0ft) across the wings and a maximum weight of 14\xa0kg (31\xa0lb), it is the largest Old World vulture and largest member of the Accipitridae family.\n\nAegypius monachus is one of the largest birds of prey and it plays a huge role in its various ecosystems by eating carcasses, and which in turn reduces the spread of diseases. The vultures are constantly exposed to many pathogens because of their eating habits. A study on the gastric and immune defense systems done in 2015, sequenced the entire genome of the cinereous genome. Comparing the vulture and the bald eagle, will allow the study to find positively selected genetic variations associated with respiration and the ability of the vulture's immune defense responses and gastric acid secretion to digest carcasses."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The genus name Aegypius is a Greek word (αἰγυπιός) for \'vulture\', or a bird not unlike one; Aelian describes the aegypius as "halfway between a vulture (gyps) and an eagle". Some authorities think this a good description of a lammergeier; others do not. Aegypius is the eponym of the species, whatever it was in ancient Greek. The English name \'black vulture\' refers to the plumage colour, while \'monk vulture\', a direct translation of its German name Mönchsgeier, refers to the bald head and ruff of neck feathers like a monk\'s cowl. \'Cinereous vulture\' (Latin cineraceus, ash-coloured; pale, whitish grey), was a deliberate attempt to rename it with a new name distinct from the American black vulture.\n\nThis bird is an Old World vulture, and as such is only distantly related to the New World vultures, which are in a separate family, Cathartidae, of the same order. It is, therefore, not closely related to the much smaller American black vulture (Coragyps atratus) despite the similar name and coloration.\n\nThe cinereous vulture measures 98–120\xa0cm (39–47\xa0in) in total length with a 2.5–3.1\xa0m (8\xa0ft 2\xa0in\xa0– 10\xa0ft 2\xa0in) wingspan. Males can weigh from 6.3 to 11.5\xa0kg (14 to 25\xa0lb), whereas females can weigh from 7.5 to 14\xa0kg (17 to 31\xa0lb). It is thus one of the world\'s heaviest flying birds. Average weights were long not known to have been published for this species but the median weight figures from two sources were 9.42\xa0kg (20.8\xa0lb) and 9.55\xa0kg (21.1\xa0lb). However in a Korean study, a large survey of wild cinereous vultures was found to have weighed an average of 9.6\xa0kg (21\xa0lb) with a mean total length of 113\xa0cm (44\xa0in), this standing as the only attempt to attain the average sizes of free-flying mature birds of the species, as opposed to nestlings or captive specimens. Unlike most accipitrids, males can broadly overlap in size with the females, although not uncommonly the females may be slightly heavier. These are one of the two largest extant Old World vultures and accipitrids, with similar total length and perhaps wingspans recorded in the Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis), as indicated by broadly similar wing and tail proportions, but the cinereous appears to be slightly heavier as well as slightly larger in tarsus and bill length. Superficially similar but unrelated New World condors can either be of similar wing area and bulk or slightly larger in these aspects.  Despite limited genetic variation in the species, body size increases from west to east based on standard measurements, with the birds from southwest Europe (Spain and south France) averaging about 10% smaller than the vultures from central Asia (Manchuria, Mongolia and northern China). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 73–89\xa0cm (29–35\xa0in), the tail is 33–41\xa0cm (13–16\xa0in) and the tarsus is 12–14.6\xa0cm (4.7–5.7\xa0in).\n\nThe cinereous vulture is distinctly dark, with the whole body being brown excepting the pale head in adults, which is covered in fine blackish down. This down is absent in the closely related lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos). The skin of the head and neck is bluish-gray and a paler whitish color above the eye. The adult has brown eyes, a purplish cere, a blue-gray bill and pale blue-gray legs. The primary quills are often actually black. From a distance, flying birds can easily appear all black. The immature plumage is sepia-brown above, with a much paler underside than in adults. Immature cinereous vultures have grey down on the head, a pale mauve cere and grey legs. Its massive bill is one of the largest of any living accipitrid, a feature enhanced by the relatively small skull of the species. The exposed culmen of the cinereous vulture measures 8–9\xa0cm (3.1–3.5\xa0in). Only their cousin, the lappet-faced vulture, with a bill length of up to about 10\xa0cm (3.9\xa0in), can rival or outsize the bill of the cinereous. The wings, with serrated leading edges, are held straight or slightly arched in flight and are broad, sometimes referred to as "barn door wings". Its flight is slow and buoyant, with deep, heavy flaps when necessary. The combination of huge size and dark coloration renders the cinereous vulture relatively distinct, especially against smaller raptors such as eagles or buzzards. The most similar-shaped species, the lappet-faced vulture (with which there might be limited range overlap in the southern Middle East), is distinguished by its bare, pinkish head and contrasting plumage. On the lappet-face, the thighs and belly are whitish in adult birds against black to brownish over the remainder of the plumage. All potential Gyps vultures are distinguished by having paler, often streaky plumage, with bulging wing primaries giving them a less evenly broad-winged form. Cinereous vultures are generally very silent, with a few querulous mewing, roaring or guttural cries solely between adults and their offspring at the nest site.\n\nThe cinereous vulture is a Eurasian species. The western limits of its range are in Spain and inland Portugal, with a reintroduced population in south France. They are found discontinuously to Greece, Turkey and throughout the central Middle East. Their range continues through Afghanistan eastwards to northern India to its eastern limits in central Asia, where they breed in northern Manchuria, Mongolia and Korea. Their range is fragmented especially throughout their European range. It is generally a permanent resident except in those parts of its range where hard winters cause limited altitudinal movement and for juveniles when they reach breeding maturity. In the eastern limits of its range, birds from the northernmost reaches may migrate down to southern Korea and China. A limited migration has also been reported in the Middle East but is not common.\n\nThis vulture is a bird of hilly, mountainous areas, especially favoring dry semi-open habitats such as meadows at high altitudes over much of the range. Nesting usually occurs near the tree line in the mountains. They are always associated with undisturbed, remote areas with limited human disturbance. They forage for carcasses over various kinds of terrain, including steppe, other grasslands, open woodlands, along riparian habitats or any kind or gradient of mountainous habitat. In their current European range and through the Caucasus and Middle East, cinereous vultures are found from 100 to 2,000\xa0m (330 to 6,560\xa0ft) in elevation, while in their Asian distribution, they are typically found at higher elevations. Two habitat types were found to be preferred by the species in China and Tibet. Some cinereous vultures in these areas live in mountainous forests and shrubland from 800 to 3,800\xa0m (2,600 to 12,500\xa0ft), while the others preferred arid or semi-arid alpine meadows and grasslands at 3,800 to 4,500\xa0m (12,500 to 14,800\xa0ft) in elevation. This species can fly at a very high altitude. One cinereous vulture was observed at an elevation of 6,970\xa0m (22,870\xa0ft) on Mount Everest. It has a specialised haemoglobin alphaD subunit of high oxygen affinity which makes it possible to take up oxygen efficiently despite the low partial pressure in the upper troposphere.\n\nThe cinereous vulture is a largely solitary bird, being found alone or in pairs much more frequently than most other Old World vultures. At large carcasses or feeding sites, small groups may congregate. Such groups can rarely include up to 12 to 20 vultures, with some older reports of up to 30 or 40.\n\nIn Europe, the cinereous vulture return to the nesting ground in January or February. In Spain and Algeria, they start nesting in February in March, in Crimea in early March, in northwestern India in February or April, in northeastern India in January, and in Turkestan in January. They breed in loose colonies, with nests rarely being found in the same tree or rock formation, unlike other Old World vultures which often nest in tight-knit colonies. In Spain, nests have been found from 300\xa0m (980\xa0ft) to 2\xa0km (1.2\xa0mi) apart from each other. The cinereous vulture breeds in high mountains and large forests, nesting in trees or occasionally on cliff ledges. The breeding season lasts from February until September or October. The most common display consists of synchronous flight movements by pairs. However, flight play between pairs and juveniles is not unusual, with the large birds interlocking talons and spiraling down through the sky. The birds use sticks and twigs as building materials, and males and females cooperate in all matters of rearing the young. The huge nest is 1.45–2\xa0m (4\xa0ft 9\xa0in\xa0– 6\xa0ft 7\xa0in) across and 1–3\xa0m (3\xa0ft 3\xa0in\xa0– 9\xa0ft 10\xa0in) deep. The nest increases in size as a pair uses it repeatedly over the years and often comes to be decorated with dung and animal skins. The nests can range up to 1.5 to 12\xa0m (4\xa0ft 11\xa0in to 39\xa0ft 4\xa0in) high in a large tree such as an oak, juniper, wild pear, almond or pine trees. Most nesting trees are found along cliffs. In a few cases, cinereous vultures have been recorded as nesting directly on cliffs. One cliff nest completely filled a ledge that was 3.63\xa0m (11.9\xa0ft) wide and 2.5\xa0m (8\xa0ft 2\xa0in) in depth. The egg clutch typically only a single egg, though two may be exceptionally laid. The eggs have a white or pale buff base color are often overlaid with red, purplish or red-brown marks, being almost as spotted as the egg of a falcon. Eggs measure from 83.4 to 104\xa0mm (3.28 to 4.09\xa0in) in height and 58 to 75\xa0mm (2.3 to 3.0\xa0in) in width, with an average of 90\xa0mm ×\xa069.7\xa0mm (3.54\xa0in ×\xa02.74\xa0in). The incubation period ranges from 50 to 62 days, averaging 50–56 days, and hatching occurs in April or May in Europe.\nThe young are covered in greyish-white to grey-brown colored down which becomes paler with age. The first flight feathers start growing from the same sockets as the down when the nestling is around 30 days old and completely cover the down by 60 days of age. The parents feed the young by regurgitation and an active nest reportedly becomes very foul and stinking. Weights of nestlings in Mongolia increased from as little as 2\xa0kg (4.4\xa0lb) when they are around a month old in early June to being slightly more massive than their parents at up to nearly 16\xa0kg (35\xa0lb) shortly before fledging in early autumn.\n\nThe nesting success of cinereous vultures is relatively high, with around 90% of eggs successfully hatching and more than half of yearling birds known to survive to adulthood. They are devoted, active parents, with both members of a breeding pair protecting the nest and feeding the young in shifts via regurgitation. In Mongolia, Pallas\'s cat (Otocolobus manul) and the common raven (Corvus corax) are considered potential predators of eggs in potentially both tree and cliff nests. Gray wolves (Canis lupus) and foxes are also mentioned as potential nest predators. There have been witnessed accounts of bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus) and Spanish imperial eagles (Aquila adalberti) attempting to kill nestlings, but in both cases they were chased off by the parents. There is a single case of a Spanish imperial eagle attacking and killing a cinereous vulture in an act of defense of its own nest in Spain. Golden eagles and Eurasian eagle-owls may rarely attempt to dispatch an older nestling or even adults in an ambush, but the species is not verified prey for either and it would be a rare event in all likelihood if it does occur. This species may live for up to 39 years, though 20 years or less is probably more common, with no regular predators of adults other than man.\n\nLike all vultures, the cinereous vulture eats mostly carrion. The cinereous vulture feeds on carrion of almost any type, from the largest mammals available to fish and reptiles. In Tibet, commonly eaten carcasses can include both wild and domestic yaks (Bos mutus and Bos grunniens), Bharal, Tibetan gazelles (Pseudois nayaur), kiangs (Equus kiang), woolly hares (Lepus oiostolus), Himalayan marmots (Marmota himalayana), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), and even humans, mainly those at their celestial burial grounds. Reportedly in Mongolia, Tarbagan marmots (Marmota sibirica) comprised the largest part of the diet, although that species is now endangered as it is preferred in the diet of local people, wild prey ranging from corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) to Argali (Ovis ammon) may be eaten additionally in Mongolia. Historically, cinereous vultures in the Iberian Peninsula fed mostly on European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) carcasses, but since viral hemorrhagic pneumonia (VHP) devastated the once abundant rabbit population there, the vultures now rely on the carrion of domestic sheep, supplemented by pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and deer. In Turkey, the dietary preferences were argali (Ovis ammon) (92 carrion items), wild boar (Sus scrofa) (53 items), chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) (27 items), gray wolves (13 items) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) (13 items). Unusually, a large amount of plant material was found in pellets from Turkey, especially pine cones. Among the vultures in its range, the cinereous is best equipped to tear open tough carcass skins thanks to its powerful bill. It can even break apart bones, such as ribs, to access the flesh of large animals. It is dominant over other scavengers in its range, even over other large vultures such as Gyps vultures, bearded vultures or fierce ground predators such as foxes. While the noisy Gyps vultures squawk and fly around, the often silent cinereous vultures will keep them well at bay until they are satisfied and have had their own fill. A series of photos taken recently show a cinereous vulture attacking a Himalayan griffon in flight for unknown reasons, although the griffon was not seriously injured. Cinereous vultures frequently bully and dominate steppe eagles (Aquila nipalensis) when the two species are attracted to the same prey and carrion while wintering in Asia. A rare successful act of kleptoparasitism on a cinereous vulture was filmed in Korea when a Steller\'s sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) stole food from the vulture.\n\nIts closest living relative is probably the lappet-faced vulture, which takes live prey on occasion. Occasionally, the cinereous vulture has been recorded as preying on live prey as well. Live animals reportedly taken by cinereous vultures include calves of yaks and domestic cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), piglets, domestic lambs and puppies (Canis lupus familiaris), foxes, lambs of wild sheep, together with nestling and fledglings of large birds such as geese, swans and pheasants, various rodents and rarely amphibians and reptiles. This species has hunted tortoises (which the vultures are likely to kill by carrying in flight and dropping on rocks to penetrate the shell; cf. Aeschylus#Death) and lizards. Although rarely observed in the act of killing ungulates, cinereous vultures have been recorded as flying low around herds and feeding on recently killed wild ungulates they are believed to have killed. Mainly neonatal lambs or calves are hunted, especially sickly ones. Although not normally thought to be a threat to healthy domestic lambs, rare predation on apparently healthy lambs has been confirmed. Species believed to be hunted by cinereous vultures have included argali, saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) and Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii).\n\nThe cinereous vulture has declined over most of its range in the last 200 years in part due to poisoning by eating poisoned bait put out to kill dogs and other predators, and to higher hygiene standards reducing the amount of available carrion; it is currently listed as Near Threatened. Vultures of all species, although not the target of poisoning operations, may be shot on sight by locals. Trapping and hunting of cinereous vultures is particularly prevalent in China and Russia, although the poaching for trophy hunting are also known for Armenia, and probably other countries in Caucasus. Perhaps an even greater threat to this desolation-loving species is development and habitat destruction. Nests, often fairly low in the main fork of a tree, are relatively easy to access and thus have been historically compromised by egg and firewood collectors regularly. The decline has been the greatest in the western half of the range, with extinction in many European countries (France, Italy, Austria, Poland, Slovakia, Albania, Moldova, Romania) and its entire breeding range in northwest Africa (Morocco and Algeria). They no longer nest in Israel. Turkey holds the second largest population of this species in the Western Palearctic. Despite the recent demographic bottleneck, this population has maintained moderate levels of genetic diversity, with no significant genetic structuring indicating that this is a single meta-population connected by frequent dispersal. More recently, protection and deliberate feeding schemes have allowed some local recoveries in numbers, particularly in Spain, where numbers increased to about 1,000 pairs by 1992 after an earlier decline to 200 pairs in 1970. This colony have now spread its breeding grounds to Portugal. Elsewhere in Europe, very small but increasing numbers breed in Bulgaria and Greece, and a re-introduction scheme is under way in France. Trends in the small populations in Ukraine (Crimea) and European Russia, and in Asian populations, are not well recorded. In the former USSR, it is still threatened by illegal capture for zoos, and in Tibet by rodenticides. It is a regular winter visitor around the coastal areas of Pakistan in small numbers. As of the turn of the 21st century, the worldwide population of cinereous vultures is estimated at 4,500–5,000 individuals.\n\nThe most recent global population estimate for Cinereous Vulture (according to Bird Life International (2017)) is 7,800-10,500 pairs, roughly equating to\n15,600-21,000 mature individuals. This consists of 2,300-2,500 pairs in Europe (2004) and 5,500-8,000 pairs in Asia.\n\nThe Hebrew word for "eagle" is also used for the cinereous vulture. As such, Biblical passages alluding to eagles might actually be referring to this or other vultures.'], 'score': 5.0345535}, {'id': 'Tadarida_brasiliensis', 'name': ['Tadarida brasiliensis'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe Mexican free-tailed bat or Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) is a medium-sized bat native to North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean, so named because its tail can be almost half its total length and is not attached to its uropatagium. It has been claimed to have the fastest horizontal speed of any animal, reaching top ground speeds over 99\xa0mph (160\xa0km/h). It also flies the highest among bats, at altitudes around 3,300\xa0m (10,800\xa0ft).\n\nIt is regarded as one of the most abundant mammals in North America. Its proclivity towards roosting in huge numbers at relatively few locations makes it vulnerable to habitat destruction in spite of its abundance. For instance, up to 1.5 million bats reside under just one bridge in Austin. The Texas Legislature designated the Mexican free-tailed bat the state mammal (flying) in 1995.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The Mexican free-tailed bat was described as a new species in 1824 by French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Geoffroy placed it in the now-defunct genus Nyctinomus with a binomial name of Nyctinomus brasiliensis.\nThe holotype had been collected in Brazil.\nMolecular sequence data indicate T. brasiliensis\'s closest relatives are the sister species Sauromys petrophilus of South Africa and Tadarida aegyptiaca of Africa and South Asia. These three species form a clade believed to be about 18 million years old.\n\nMexican free-tailed bats are typically 9\xa0cm (3.5\xa0in) in length and weigh around 7–12\xa0g (0.25–0.42\xa0oz) with females tending to be slightly heavier than males by 1-2 grams for increased fat storage to use during gestation and nursing. \nTheir tails are almost half their total length and stretch beyond the uropatagium, giving them the name "free-tailed" bats. Their ears are wide, rounded, and large compared to their heads, nearly meeting at the front of the face, but distinctly not joined at the midline and projecting anterodorsally from just before the muzzle to the back of the head. They use their large ears to help them find prey using echolocation. T. brasiliensis is distinguished among North American Tadarida bats in possessing deep wrinkles on the upper lip and in having a Z-shaped upper third molar, which is used for grinding insects. These individuals possess canines which are larger in males than in females. The wings are elongated and narrow with pointed tips, making them well-equipped for quick, straight flight patterns. Their fur color ranges from dark brown to gray. The Mexican free-tailed bat\'s large feet have distinct long, white bristles. These bristles, namely those on digits one and five and the toes, as well as on the edge of the uropatagium, are photoluminescent under ultraviolet light. The function of this trait, if any, are unknown.\n\nThe dental formula of Tadarida brasiliensis is 1.1.1.33.1.2.3.\n\nThe Mexican free-tailed bat ranges from the southern half of the continental United States through most of Mexico, and through most of Central America into South America. Their range in South America is less understood where they live in the eastern Brazilian highlands and coast, the northeastern Andes, the coast of Peru and northern Chile, and the center of Argentina. They are absent in much of the Amazon rainforest. They are also found in the Caribbean, and are native to all of the Greater Antilles and 11 of the Lesser Antilles. The largest known colony is found at Bracken Cave, north of San Antonio, Texas, with nearly 20 million bats; the bats from this colony congregate in huge numbers at altitudes between 180 and 1,000\xa0m (590 and 3,280\xa0ft), and even as high as 3,000\xa0m (9,800\xa0ft).\n\nMexican free-tailed bats roost primarily in caves. However, they also roost in buildings of any type as long as they have access to openings and dark recesses in ceilings or walls. The bats can make roosting sites of buildings regardless of "age, height, architecture, construction materials, occupancy by humans and compass orientation". Caves, though, need to have enough wall and ceiling space to fit millions of bats. Before buildings, free-tailed bats in the Southeastern United States probably roosted in the hollows of trees such as red mangrove, black mangrove, white mangrove, and cypress. However, most bats in Florida seem to prefer buildings and other man-made structures over natural roosts. Caves in Florida tend to be occupied mostly by the southeastern myotis. Caves in Florida tend to have pools of water on the floor and the free-tailed bats do not need as much relative humidity as the southeastern myotis.\n\nMexican free-tailed bats in southeastern Nevada, southwestern Utah, western Arizona, and southeastern California come together to migrate southwest to southern California and Baja California. Bats in southeastern Utah, southwestern Colorado, western New Mexico, and eastern Arizona travel through the western edge of the Sierra Madre Oriental into Jalisco, Sinaloa, and Sonora. Some bats that summer in Kansas, Oklahoma, eastern New Mexico, and Texas migrate southward to South Texas and Mexico. Some bat populations in other areas of North America do not migrate, but are residents and may make seasonal changes in roost sites. While this migration is extremely extensive, a way must exist for these bats to continuously congregate in the same roosts every year. T. brasiliensis bats have copious numbers of sebaceous glands covering their entire bodies. These glands leave a trace of a lasting scent to which other bats are sensitive. This odor is crucial to marking habitual roosts.\n\nBats ranging eastward from East Texas do not migrate, but local shifts in roost usage often occur seasonally. Also, a regional population that ranges from Oregon to California, has a year-round residence.\n\nMexican free-tailed bats are primarily insectivores. They hunt their prey using echolocation. The bats eat moths, beetles, dragonflies, flies, true bugs, wasps, and ants. They usually catch flying prey in flight. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats fly hundreds of meters above the ground in Texas to feed on migrating insects. The consumption of insects by these bats can be quite significant.\n\nThe onset of evening emergence from caves and the end of returns at dawn tend to correlate with sunset and sunrise, respectively, with dawn returns ending increasingly later in correlation to sunrise throughout the summer season. Reproductive females tended to emerge earlier in the evening and return later at dawn to gather the extra nutrients they require for reproduction and offspring care. T. brasiliensis bats spend around 60% of their active time foraging while aerial, mostly hunting at heights of 6–15\xa0m (20–49\xa0ft). Individuals will fly 50\xa0km (31\xa0mi) in one night to reach foraging areas. The loose, wrinkled skin around the mouth is thought to aid in expanding the mouth during flight to catch insects. T. brasiliensis requires free water sources to maintain water balance: individuals from the arid environment of New Mexico tend to have thicker renal tissue layers compared to T. brasiliensis from the less arid California, revealing that urine concentrating abilities and water use varies geographically with aridity.\n\nOne individual bat was recorded to have lived eight years, based on dentition.[page\xa0needed]  Predators of the bat include large birds such as red-tailed hawk, American kestrels, great horned owls, barn owls, and Mississippi kites. Mammal predators include Virginia opossums, striped skunks, and raccoons. Snakes such as eastern coachwhips and gopher snakes may also prey on them, but at a lesser extent. Certain types of beetles prey on neonate and juvenile bats that have fallen to the ground. This species seems to have a low incidence of rabies, at least in the United States. They do, however, contain certain pesticides.\n\nWhite-nose syndrome (WNS) caused by infection by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans has increased in prevalence since 2006, mostly affecting species of bats that roost underground such as the little brown bat. The fungus, now suspected to have spread from accidental transportation by human cave workers, is thought to cause frequent arousals during bat hibernation, causing an individual to use fat stores much more quickly and die of starvation before the end of winter. WNS can affect T. brasiliensis, but has yet to be greatly introduced to their habitat due to their preference for more arid caves. WNS has low prevalence in the subtropical and tropical regions where T. brasiliensis resides.\n\nCertain chemicals in the fur of these bats have antimicrobial activity against common mammalian skin pathogens. The chemical nonanal is found in such a concentration that its antimicrobial activity can inhibit the growth of two fungal pathogens that cause ringworm (Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. rubrum), as well as Malassezia furfur, a yeast. Two other common skin disease-causing microbes that are inhibited by the hair\'s concentration of nonanal include Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium acnes. \n\nMexican free-tailed bats are nocturnal foragers and begin feeding after dusk. They travel 50\xa0km in a quick, direct flight pattern to feed. This species flies the highest among bats, at altitudes around 3,300\xa0m (10,800\xa0ft). Bats appear to be most active in late morning and afternoon between June and September. Free-tailed bats are more active in warm weather.\n\nThe species has been measured at a ground speed of 160\xa0km/h (99\xa0mph), measured by an aircraft tracking device. The measurement methodology did not simultaneously record wind speed and ground speed, so the observations could have been affected by strong local gusts, and the bat\'s maximum air speed remains uncertain.\n\nAmong bats that roost in great, concentrated numbers, T. brasiliensis roosts produce large quantities of urine and guano; from 22 to 99 metric tons per cave and over 18,700 metric tons are produced annually. The concentrated waste generates high levels of toxic ammonia in the air of a cave. T. brasiliensis individuals have genetic adaptation for withstanding or countering these high levels of ammonia. The bats\' content of CO2 and protein in respiratory mucus and CO2 dissolved in blood plasma increase with increasing levels of dissolved ammonia, providing the bats with a buffer against pH change. This allows the bats to filter out a large majority of inhaled ammonia before it reaches toxic levels in the blood. T. brasiliensis bats are thought to swarm in spiraling motions within caves to ventilate ammonia and renew the air.\n\nMexican free-tailed bats use echolocation for navigation and detecting prey. Traveling calls are of a brief but constant frequency. However, they switch modulated frequency calls between 40 and 75\xa0kHz if they detect something. Typically, the frequency range of their echolocation is between 49 and 70\xa0kHz, but can be between 25 and 40\xa0kHz if something crosses their path while in flight.\n\nOn 6 November 2014, Aaron Corcoran, a biologist at Wake Forest University, North Carolina, reported online in Science that his team and he had detected Mexican free-tailed bats emitting ultrasonic vocalizations that had the effect of jamming the echolocation calls of a rival bat species hunting moths. The \'jamming\' call led to an increased chance of the rival missing its prey, which the Mexican free-tailed bat was then able to eat itself. Earlier researchers had discovered some 15 types of social calls made by Mexican free-tailed bats and reported that they could adjust their calls to avoid interfering with others in range of their calls.\n\nDuring the breeding season, females aggregate into maternity roosts. The size of these roosts depends on the environment, with caves having the larger roosts. Mating can occur in an aggressive or passive form. In the aggressive form, the male controls the female\'s movements, keeping her away from the other bats in the roost. He also tends to vocalize when mating. During passive copulation, the males simply flies to a female in her roost and quietly mounts her with no resistance. This species is a promiscuous breeder and both sexes copulate with multiple partners. Females become sexually mature at about 9 months, while males take even longer, at two years. Females enter estrus once a year, which typically lasts five weeks in the spring. The gestation period of the bat lasts 11–12 weeks, with only one young being born. A number of pups are left in "creches", while their mothers roost elsewhere. The female uses vocalizations and scent to identify her pup. The mother imprints her scent on the young early on. However, young try to steal a suckle from any female that passes through the cluster. Through examining the genotypes of female-pup nursing pairs sampled from colonies in Texas, it has been measured that nursing is partially selective along genetic lines, with approximately 17% of mothers nursing pups that were not their offspring, ostensibly due to the difficulty of consistently locating and selectively nursing their own pups in extremely large colonies. A mother will nurse her young daily, and by 4–7 weeks old they are full grown, fully weaned, and independent.\n\nThough abundant and widespread, some local populations have prompted protection and conservation efforts. For instance, during the spring and summer, one of the largest Mexican free-tailed bat populations inhabits Cueva de la Boca, a cave near Monterrey, Mexico. In 2006, the Mexican environmental conservation NGO, Pronatura Noreste, purchased the property. Because of a reduction by more than 95% of the original 20 million bat population to 600,000, as a result of vandalism, pollution, and uncontrolled tourism, the organization decided to buy the property to place it under conservation. Other species of high ecological value that inhabit the cavern are also being protected. \nSimilarly, Bat Conservation International bought Bracken Cave from private ownership in 1992. BCI planned to revert any land changes that were a result of farming or ranching in order to conserve the biodiversity and wildlife there. Preserving the land around Bracken Cave was important, as it is home to the world\'s largest bat colony, and any human encroachment would be detrimental to their population. BCI also protects the land from artificial light pollution, which can distress the bats.\n\nIn Austin, Texas, a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats summers (they winter in Mexico) under the Congress Avenue Bridge 10 blocks south of the Texas State Capitol. It is the largest urban colony in North America, with an estimated 1,500,000 bats. Each night they eat 10,000 to 30,000\xa0lb (4,500 to 13,600\xa0kg) of insects. Each year, they attract 100,000 tourists who come to watch them. In Houston, Texas, a colony is living under the Waugh Street Bridge over Buffalo Bayou. It is the home to 250,000 bats and also attracts viewers. The Mexican free-tailed bat is the official flying mammal of the state of Texas, as well as Oklahoma.\n\nHundreds of tons of guano were mined in Texas annually between 1900 and 1980. In the early 20th century, bat guano was Texas\' largest mineral export, before oil. In 1863, a gun powder factory opened near San Antonio, the saltpeter of which was provided by local guano mines.'], 'score': 5.01597}, {'id': 'Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis_harrissoni', 'name': ['Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe Bornean rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni), also known as the eastern Sumatran rhinoceros or eastern hairy rhinoceros, is one of three subspecies of Sumatran rhinoceros.

In April 2015, the Malaysian government declared the Bornean rhinoceros to be extinct in the wild in the Malaysian portion of Borneo. However, in March 2016, a young female rhino was captured in East Kalimantan (in the Indonesian portion of Borneo), providing evidence of their continued existence. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the subspecies as critically endangered.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ["The Bornean subspecies Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni, was named in honour of the British polymath Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s.\n\nThe Bornean rhinoceros is markedly smaller than the other two subspecies, making it the smallest of the extant rhinos. The weight of an adult individual ranges from 600–950\xa0kg (1,320–2,090\xa0lb), the height from 1–1.5\xa0m (3\xa0ft 3\xa0in\xa0– 4\xa0ft 11\xa0in) and the bodylength from 2–3\xa0m (6\xa0ft 7\xa0in\xa0– 9\xa0ft 10\xa0in). The Bornean rhinoceros has the darkest skin of the Sumatran rhinos, and the fur of calves is much denser, but it becomes darker and more sparse as the animal matures. The head size is also relatively smaller. The rhinoceros has fringed ears and wrinkles around its eyes. Like the black rhinoceros it has a prehensile lip. The difference from the Western Sumatran rhinoceros is mainly genetic.\n\nBornean rhinos used to range all over Borneo, but their range has been severely reduced. Previously, the entire known wild population lived in Sabah, mostly in the Tabin Wildlife Reserve. However, this population is now believed to be extinct. A recently captured specimen and video evidence from camera traps have confirmed their continued presence in East Kalimantan, now believed to hold the entire wild population. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed.\n\nToday, the Bornean rhinoceros, like the Sumatran rhino, lives in hot, humid closed canopy rainforest. However, being a species which existed before the end of the Pleistocene, it is likely that this was not the habitat in which they evolved.\n\nThe Bornean rhinoceros, like most rhinos, is a solitary animal that lives in dense rainforest and swamps. It usually feeds at dusk and bathes in mud during the day. The animals eat around 50\xa0kg (110\xa0lb) of plant matter per day. Rare minerals are gained from salt licks. These animals are very good swimmers and can maneuver well on steep slopes. They mark their territory with scrapings, bent saplings and scent marks. The Bornean subspecies may also be more of a browser than most Asian rhinos.\n\nIn April 2007, it was announced that a camera trap in Sabah had captured footage of a Bornean rhinoceros eating and investigating the equipment. This was the first footage showing the elusive rhino's natural behavior in the wild.\n\nBy the start of the 1900s, the Bornean rhinoceros was common throughout its native range. But the population has declined dramatically, and has been reduced to an estimated 15 individuals. It is thought to be extinct in East Malaysia and most of Kalimantan and now can only be found in East Kalimantan.\n\nThis animal is highly threatened by hunting, poaching for their horn, habitat loss, and by having a small, scattered population.\n\nIn the 1930s, a huge wave of hunting by natives wiped out much of the rhino's population. The natives killed the rhinos and traded their horns to China. In traditional Chinese culture, rhino horns have special medicinal powers that can heal many ailments. Despite many scientific studies proving this to be false, the market of rhino horns for Chinese medicine has continued, leading to poachers having further decimated the Bornean rhino's population. Using mining and logging roads which cut through already fragmented rainforest, poachers were able to more easily track down rhinos. Poachers continue to be one of the largest threats to the Bornean rhinoceros and local wildlife patrols were increased in November 2015 to protect the remaining population.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, large-scale logging for international consumption heavily degraded or completely cleared much of Borneo's rainforest. In 2013, it was found that 80% of Malaysian Borneo's forests were heavily impacted by logging. In the 1990s, palm oil became a huge industry in Borneo, having an even larger effect on rhinos and other native species. While animals can still survive in logged forests, palm oil plantations cannot support wildlife and thus completely wiping out the animals previously living in the area.\n\nThe widespread habitat destruction and hunting of the Bornean rhinoceros soon led to the population being too fragmented to repopulate. Being extremely elusive and solitary animals, many individuals and populations were separated, making it nearly impossible for the animals to find mates and reproduce. Many of the rhinos captured on camera traps and identified in the wild in the past decade have been largely isolated from other rhinos, and the remaining 15 animals are split up between three isolated populations.\n\nIn 2008, it was estimated that there were around 50 rhinos left in the wild in Sabah, with this number dropping to only 10 in 2013. In April 2015, the Bornean rhinoceros was declared to be extinct in Sabah and thought to be completely extinct in the wild.\n\nIn 2013, a single rhino was identified in East Kalimantan through footprints and a single image caught by a camera trap. However, this individual was thought to be a lone specimen, and the population was believed to have also gone extinct. Then, in March 2016, experts announced that 15 animals had been identified in the region, with researchers for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) capturing a live animal in a pit trap in Kutai Barat around the same time. The animal was identified as a female between the age of four and five years old. The discovery proved that the subspecies still existed in the wild and that there were potentially enough animals left to save them. Researchers hope to find at least 10 more animals.\n\nThe WWF plans to create a new sanctuary for Bornean rhinos on 200\xa0ha (490 acres) of the 4,561\xa0ha (11,270 acres) Kelian Protected Forest (site of the former Kelian Mine) and move the remaining wild rhinos there to create a larger protected breeding population. The female rhino (named Najaq) was captured in preparation for this, and was moved to a temporary enclosure with plans to airlift her to the protected forest. However, a few days after her capture, Najaq died from an infection on her leg, believed to be caused by a poacher's snare trap.\n\nThe Bornean rhinoceros is extremely rare in captivity, with only one individual (female) remaining in captivity at the Borneo Rhinoceros Sanctuary in Sabah. The potential captive breeding of this animals is mostly threatened by the remaining individual being unable to breed. The last male (named Tam) died on May 27, 2019.\n\nIn February 2014, a decision was made to send Tam to the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden to breed with its female Western Sumatran rhinoceros, Suci. The decision to breed the two subspecies together was made in a last-ditch attempt to save the species as a whole and due to the fact that Puntung and Iman are non-reproductive and Suci's only other breeding option in captivity was her brother. The plan later was canceled due to the death of Suci in March 2014 due to Iron Storage Disease. Puntung fell ill and was euthanized in May 2017, so in late 2018 a new female rhinoceros, named Pahu, was captured for the captive breeding program. Tam died from old age in May 2019, leaving Iman and Pahu as the last surviving captive Bornean rhinoceros. However, Iman also passed away in November 2019, leaving the species locally extinct in Malaysian Borneo and leaving Pahu as the last Bornean rhinoceros in captivity."], 'score': 4.992879}, {'id': 'Myobatrachidae', 'name': ['Myobatrachidae'], 'introduction': ['\n\nSee text\n\nRheobatrachinae Heyer & Liem, 1976\n\nMyobatrachidae, commonly known as Australian ground frogs or Australian water frogs, is a family of frogs found in Australia and New Guinea.

It was the last known North American sauropod prior to an absence of the group on the continent of roughly 40 million years that ended with the appearance of Alamosaurus during the Maastrichtian.\n\nWhile the holotype remains were initially discovered in 1994, due to their unexpected age and unusual size they were initially misclassified as pieces of petrified wood. A more detailed analysis in 1999 revealed their true nature which resulted in a minor media frenzy, and formal publication of the find the following year.\n\nPaleoecological analysis indicates that Sauroposeidon lived on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, in a river delta. Extrapolations based on the more completely known Brachiosaurus indicate that the head of Sauroposeidon could reach 16.5–18\xa0m (54–59\xa0ft) in height with its neck extended, which would make it one of the tallest known dinosaurs.

Analysis of these remains and comparison with others from Texas supported this conclusion, and demonstrated that the more completely known sauropods from the Twin Mountains Formation (including a partial skull and fossil trackways) previously named Paluxysaurus jonesi also belonged to Sauroposeidon. It is the state dinosaur of Texas.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The first fossils classified as Sauroposeidon were four neck vertebrae discovered in rural Oklahoma, not far from the Texas border, in a claystone outcrop that dates the fossils to about 110\xa0million years ago (mya). This falls within the Early Cretaceous Period, specifically between the Aptian and Albian epochs. These vertebrae were discovered in May 1994 at the Antlers Formation in Atoka County, Oklahoma by dog trainer Bobby Cross and secured by Dr. Richard Cifelli and a team from the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in May 1994 and August 1994. Initially the fossils were believed to be simply too large to be the remains of an animal, and due to the state of preservation, believed to be tree trunks. In fact, they are the longest such bones known in dinosaurs. Thus, the vertebrae were stored until 1999, when Dr. Cifelli gave them to a graduate student, Matt Wedel, to analyze as part of a project. Upon their realization of the find\'s significance, they issued a press release in October 1999, followed by official publication of their findings in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology in March 2000. The new species was named S. proteles, and the holotype is OMNH 53062. It garnered immediate media attention leading to some sources calling it inaccurately the largest dinosaur ever.\n\nThe generic name comes from sauros (Greek σαύρος for "lizard"), and Poseidon (Ποσειδών), the sea god in Greek mythology, who is also associated with earthquakes, that facet styled as Ennosigaios or Enosikhthōn, "Earthshaker". This is a reference  to the notion that a sauropod\'s weight was so great that the ground shook as it walked.\n\nThe specific descriptor proteles also comes from the Ancient Greek πρωτέλης and means "perfect before the end", which refers to Sauroposeidon\'s status as the last and most specialized giant sauropod known in North America, during the Early Cretaceous.\n\nIn 2012, numerous other sauropod remains that had been known for decades under various different names were also classified in the genus Sauroposeidon. Sauropod bones and trackways had long been known from the Paluxy River area of Texas, usually referred to the genus Pleurocoelus, including partial skeletons (particularly from the Glen Rose Formation, above the Twin Mountains Formation). In the mid 1980s, students from the University of Texas at Austin discovered a bonebed on a ranch in Hood County, but early work stopped in 1987. The quarry was reopened in 1993 and was subsequently worked by parties from Southern Methodist University, the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, and Tarleton State University. All sauropod remains from this bonebed appear to come from the same genus of sauropod. Petrified logs are also known from the site. The site was fluvial when its rocks were being deposited, with channel sands and muds, and concretions of calcite-cemented sandstone containing fossils. Following excavation and preparation of the majority of the fossils from the site, its sauropod species was given the name Paluxysaurus jonesi.\n\nThe name Paluxysaurus was based on the specimen FWMSH 93B-10-18, a partial skull including an associated left maxilla, nasal, and teeth. Other bones from the quarry included a partial neck of seven vertebrae, thirteen vertebrae from the back and 30 from the tail, and examples of all limb and girdle bones except some hand and foot bones. It was distinguished from all other sauropods by vertebral details, and has various morphological differences in other bones compared to other sauropods of the Early Cretaceous of North America. The genus was limited to the bonebed remains; for example, the partial skeleton from Wise County known as Pleurocoelus sp. (SMU 61732) is not referred to Paluxysaurus; instead that specimen is the holotype of Astrophocaudia slaughteri D\'Emic 2012, another somphospondylan sauropod. There are differences in the remains of P. sp. and Paluxysaurus, but they cannot be distinguished with confidence. In 2012, re-analysis of these specimens in light of additional Sauroposeidon remains led paleontologists D\'Emic and Foreman to conclude that Paluxysaurus was the same animal as Sauroposeidon, and thus a junior synonym of S. proteles.\n\nIt\'s truly astonishing. It\'s arguably the largest creature ever to walk the earth.\n\nThe press release in 1999 immediately garnered international media attention, which led to many (inaccurate) news reports of "the largest dinosaur ever!". While Sauroposeidon likely represents the tallest known dinosaur taxon, it does not hold records for either the longest or most massive. Maraapunisaurus or Argentinosaurus make better candidates for the title "World\'s Largest Dinosaur", though incomplete fossil evidence (and in the case of Maraapunisaurus, lost) makes exact rankings impossible.\n\nThe original Sauroposeidon find was composed of four articulated, mid-cervical vertebrae (numbers 5 to 8), with the cervical ribs[clarification needed] in place. The vertebrae are extremely elongated, with the largest one having an overall length of 1.4\xa0m (4.6\xa0ft), making it the longest sauropod neck vertebra on record. Examination of the bones revealed that they are honeycombed with tiny air cells, and are very thin, like the bones of a chicken or an ostrich, making the neck lighter and easier to lift. The cervical ribs were remarkably long as well, with the longest measurable rib (on vertebra 6) measuring 3.42\xa0m (11.2\xa0ft) – about 18% longer than the longest rib reported for Giraffatitan, but exceeded in length by the cervical ribs of Mamenchisaurus.\n\nEstimates of Sauroposeidon\'s size are based on a comparison between the four Sauroposeidon vertebrae and the vertebrae of the HM SII specimen of Giraffatitan brancai, located in the Berlin\'s Natural History Museum. The HM SII is the most complete brachiosaur known, though since it is composed of pieces from different individuals its proportions may not be totally accurate. Comparisons to the other relatives of Sauroposeidon are difficult due to limited remains.\nThe neck length of Sauroposeidon is estimated at 11.25–12\xa0m (37–39\xa0ft), compared to a neck length of 9\xa0m (30\xa0ft) for the HM SII Giraffatitan. This is based on the assumption that the rest of the neck has the same proportions as Giraffatitan, which is a reasonably good conjecture.\n\nSauroposeidon was probably able to raise its head 16.5–18\xa0m (54–59\xa0ft) above the ground, which is as high as a six-story building. In comparison, Giraffatitan could probably raise its head 13.5\xa0m (44\xa0ft) into the air.\n\nSauroposeidon\'s shoulder height has been estimated at 6–7\xa0m (20–23\xa0ft) based on an interpretation of the animal as a brachiosaurid. Estimates of its total possible length have ranged from 27\xa0m (89\xa0ft) to 34\xa0m (112\xa0ft).\n\nThe mass of Sauroposeidon is estimated at 40–60\xa0t (44–66 short tons). While the vertebrae of Sauroposeidon are 25–33%\xa0longer than Giraffatitan\', they are only 10–15%\xa0larger in diameter. This means that while Sauroposeidon probably has a larger body than Giraffatitan its body is smaller in comparison to the size of its neck, so it did not weigh as much as a scaled-up Giraffatitan. By comparison, Giraffatitan might have weighed 36–40\xa0t (40–44 short tons). This estimate of the Giraffatitan is an average of several different methodologies.\n\nHowever, Sauroposeidon has a gracile neck compared to Giraffatitan. If the rest of the body turns out to be similarly slender, the mass estimate may be too high. This could be similar to the way the relatively robust Apatosaurus weighs far more than the longer but much slimmer Diplodocus. In addition, it is possible that sauropods may have had an air sac system, like those in birds, which could reduce all sauropod mass estimates by 20%\xa0or more.\n\nSauroposeidon was an unexpected discovery, because it was a huge, gas-guzzling barge of an animal in an age of subcompact sauropods.\n\nSauropods, which include the largest terrestrial animals of all time, were a very wide-ranging and successful group. They first appeared in the Early Jurassic and soon spread across the world. By the time of the late Jurassic, North America and Africa were dominated by the diplodocids and brachiosaurids and, by the end of the Late Cretaceous, titanosaurids were widespread (though only in the southern hemisphere). Between these periods, in the Early Cretaceous, the fossil record is sparse. Few specimens have been found in North America from that time and those specimens that do exist are often fragmentary or represent juvenile members of their species. Most of the surviving sauropods at the time were also shrinking in size to a mere 15\xa0m (49\xa0ft) in length, and maybe 10–15\xa0t (11–17 short tons), which makes the discovery of an extremely specialized super-giant like Sauroposeidon very unusual.\n\nSauroposeidon lived on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, which ran through Oklahoma at that time, in a vast river delta similar to the Mississippi delta today. This paleoenvironment, which has been preserved in the Antlers Formation, also stretches from southwest Arkansas through southeastern Oklahoma and into northeastern Texas. This geological formation has not been dated radiometrically. Scientists have used biostratigraphic data and the fact that it shares several of the same genera as the Trinity Group of Texas, to surmise that this formation was laid down during the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, approximately 110 mya. The area preserved in this formation was a large floodplain that drained into a shallow inland sea. Several million years later, this sea would expand to the north, becoming the Western Interior Seaway and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire Late Cretaceous period. The paleoenvironment of Sauroposeidon consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests, river deltas, coastal swamps, bayous and lagoons, probably similar to that of modern-day Louisiana. There were few predators which could attempt to attack a full-grown Sauroposeidon, but juveniles were likely to be preyed on by the contemporary Acrocanthosaurus atokensis  (a carnosaur slightly smaller than a Tyrannosaurus), which likely were the apex predators in this region, and the small dromaeosaur Deinonychus antirrhopus. Sauroposeidon also shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as the sauropod Astrodon (Pleurocoelus) and the most common dinosaur in this region, the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Other vertebrates present during this time included the amphibian Albanerpeton arthridion, the reptiles Atokasaurus metarsiodon and Ptilotodon wilsoni, the cartilaginous fish Hybodus buderi and Lissodus anitae, the ray-finned fish Gyronchus dumblei, the crocodilians Goniopholis, Bernissartia, and Paluxysuchus, and the turtles Glyptops and Naomichelys. Possible indeterminate bird remains are also known from the Antlers Formation. The fossil evidence suggests that the gar Lepisosteus was the most common vertebrate in this region. The early mammals known from this region included Atokatherium boreni and Paracimexomys crossi.'], 'score': 4.8618555}, {'id': 'Edestus_giganteus', 'name': ['Edestus giganteus'], 'introduction': ['\n\nEdestus is an extinct genus of eugeneodontid holocephalian fish known from the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) of the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States. Most remains consist of isolated curved blades or "whorls" that are studded with teeth, that in life were situated within the midline of the upper and lower jaws. Edestus is a Greek name derived from the word edeste (to devour), in reference to the aberrant quality and size of the species\' teeth. The largest species, E. heinrichi, has been conservatively estimated to reach greater than 6.7\xa0m (22\xa0ft) in length, around the size of the largest known great white shark, possibly making it the largest marine predator to have ever existed up to that point.\n\nLike its other relatives, such as Helicoprion, and unlike modern sharks, the species of Edestus grew teeth in curved blades or "whorls". In Edestus\' case, only a single row of teeth occurred in the midline of each jaw, leading Edestus to sometimes be described as the "scissor tooth shark". The degree of curvature in the teeth brackets, along with size, are distinct in each species.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['Edestus was first described by Joseph Leidy in 1856. The type species is Edestus vorax, the holotype specimen (ANSP 9899) is very fragmentary and of uncertain stratigraphic and geographic provenance, reported to be from Muskogee County, Oklahoma, though this has been questioned. In 1855 Edward Hitchcock presented a specimen of Edestus to the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Providence, Rhode Island the specimen (a tooth whorl) had been originally found in Parke County, Indiana. The specimen was loaned to famed British anatomist Richard Owen in 1861, who referred the specimen to Edestus and suggested that it was a fin spine. Edestus minor was described in 1866 by John Strong Newberry based on AMNH FF477, a single crown that lacks most of the root from Posey County, Indiana. Edestus heinrichi was described in 1870 by Newberry and Amos Henry Worthen from a now-lost specimen found in Illinois. Edestus triserratus was described in 1904 by Edwin Tulley Newton, from GSM 31410, which was found in the Coal Measures in Staffordshire, England which is a partial tooth lacking the apex of the crown. Oliver Perry Hay in 1912 was the first to describe an associated pair of upper and lower tooth whorls (USNM V7255), found in a coal mine near Lehigh, Iowa, which he assigned to the new species Edestus mirus, now thought to be a synonym of Edestus minor. Specimens of Edestus are also known from the Moscow Basin on the Russian Platform. Edestus karpinskii was described by A.B. Missuna in 1908 from remains found near Kolomna around 100 km southeast of Moscow. Edestus minusculus was described by Hay in 1912 from a specimen originally described by Alexander Karpinsky as Edestus cf. minor from a specimen found at the Myachkova quarry, near Moscow.\n\nThe whorls of Edestus are composed of numerous serrated teeth that have long v-shaped roots that are stacked on top of each other akin to roof tiling. Up to a dozen teeth are present in each whorl at any one time. Teeth grew in the back end (posterior) of the whorl, and gradually migrated forward through the whorl, before being ejected at the front end (anterior). Up to 40 teeth could have grown in each whorl during the lifetime of the animal. The upper and lower whorls are distinct in their morphology, with the lower whorl having a greater degree of curvature.\n\nAs with most cartilaginous fish, preserved skeletal material is rare, due to the cartilage of the skeleton having a poor potential for fossilisation. Several specimens with the preserved cranial remains of Edestus have been reported, the most important being FMNH PF2204, a crushed juvenile specimen, likely representative of E. heinrichi, which preserves both upper and lower blades in association with a well preserved chondrocranium and jaws. The Meckel\'s cartilage of the lower jaw is approximately 1.5 times the length of the lower whorl, the end of the lower whorl extends forward beyond the edge of the Meckel\'s cartiilage. The Meckel\'s cartilage was articulated with a slender quadrate via a socket in the Meckel\'s cartilage which articlulated with a process of the quadrate. The quadrate at its other end articulated with the otic process of the chondrocranium, the structure that houses the brain and sensory organs. The upper tooth blade was rigidly held between two plates of palatine cartilage, which at their front ends are crescent shaped, matching the curvature of the tooth whorl, with the upper whorl extending forward beyond the cartilage. The chondrocranium was capped by a shield-shaped dorsal plate.\n\nNo postcranial remains are known of Edestus. However, poscranial remains are known for other eugeneodont genera. Eugeneodonts with preserved postcrania include the Pennsylvanian to Triassic-age caseodontoids Caseodus, Fadenia, and Romerodus. These taxa have a fusiform (streamlined, torpedo-shaped) body plan, with triangular pectoral fins. There is a single large and triangular dorsal fin without a fin spine, and a tall, forked caudal fin which externally appears to be homocercal (with two equally-sized lobes). This general body plan is shared by active, open-water predatory fish such as tuna, swordfish, and lamnid sharks. Eugeneodonts also lack pelvic and anal fins, and judging by Romerodus, they would have had broad keels along the side of the body up to the caudal fin. Fadenia had five well-exposed gill slits, possibly with a vestigial sixth gill. There is no evidence of the specialized gill basket and fleshy operculum present in living chimaeroids.\n\nThe cranium of FMNH PF2204 is around 25 centimetres (9.8\xa0in) in length, and the associated upper and lower whorls have lengths of 10.4 and 8 centimetres (4.1 and 3.1\xa0in), respectively. The largest known individuals of E. heinrichi are an upper whorl  32 centimetres (13\xa0in) in length and a lower whorl 43 centimetres (17\xa0in) in length. The estimated minimum length of the skulls of these individuals based on allometry are around 77 and 134 centimetres (30 and 53\xa0in), respectively. Based on a 5:1 body length to head ratio, this suggests that individuals of E. heinrichi could reach lengths of about or more than 6.7\xa0m (22\xa0ft). This estimate has been corroborated by Engelman (2023) based on allometric scaling, who also suggested that Edestus was likely the largest marine predator to have ever existed up until that point, given that earlier large predators like Dunkleosteus were probably smaller than previously thought.\n\nDue to the unusual nature of the tooth whorls and the historic lack of cranial material, many hypotheses for how the whorls functioned have been proposed. Early hypotheses suggested that they were indeed teeth or were defensive spines located on the fins. Wayne M. Itano proposed that the whorls were arranged vertically to slash prey. In the description of the cranial material of Edestus, Tapanila and colleagues (2018) found that the tooth whorls functioned as effective grasping and slicing tools for soft bodied prey. The jaws of Edestus were operated by a two gear system, involving double jointing of the quadrate bone allowing for forward and backward movement of the lower jaw, similar to the streptostyly seen in living squamates, with an estimated force output of 1907 newtons. The authors proposed that during prey approach, adductor muscles pulled the Meckel\'s cartilage of the lower jaw upwards and forwards to close the jaw, causing each tooth to slice roughly three times its length, and further push the prey into the teeth of the upper whorl. During the subsequent opening of the jaw mouth the Meckel\'s cartilage moved backwards and downwards by the adductor muscles, causing further slicing.\n\n13 species of Edestus have been named, but in a 2019 morphometric analysis only 4 were considered valid, which span a six million year interval in the Late Carboniferous (313-307 million years ago). Species of Edestus are divided into two groups, those which have asymmetrical crowns that slant forwards, and those with symmetrical ones. The earliest known species are from the late Bashkirian of the United Kingdom, with the first appearances in Russia and the United States during the Moscovian, corresponding to a rise in sea level. These localities were situated in paleoequatorial tropical latitudes. Most remains of Edestus are found in marine shales that overlie coal swamp deposits as a result of marine transgression events.\n\nAsymmetric crowns\n\nSymmetric crowns\n\nEdestus newtoni, described by Arthur Smith Woodward in 1916 from the "Millstone Grit" of Yorkshire, United Kingdom, has a much greater curvature of the whorl than other species of Edestus, and has sometimes been placed in its own genus Lestrodus. A placement in a separate genus is supported by its lack of a convex bulge opposite the tooth crowns, which is present on all other species of Edestus.'], 'score': 4.8582473}, {'id': 'Broghammerus_reticulatus', 'name': ['Broghammerus reticulatus'], 'introduction': ["\n\nThe reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus) is a python species native to South and Southeast Asia. It is the world's longest snake, and the third heaviest after the green anaconda and Burmese python. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution. In several countries in its range, it is hunted for its skin, for use in traditional medicine, and for sale as pets. Due to this, reticulated pythons are one of the most economically important reptiles worldwide.\n\nIt is an excellent swimmer, has been reported far out at sea, and has colonized many small islands within its range.\n\nLike all pythons, it is a non-venomous constrictor. In very rare cases, adult humans have been killed (and in at least six reported cases, eaten) by reticulated pythons."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The reticulated python was first described in 1801 by German naturalist Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider, who described two zoological specimens held by the Göttingen Museum in 1801 that differed slightly in colour and pattern as separate species—Boa reticulata and Boa rhombeata. The specific name, reticulatus, is Latin meaning "net-like", or reticulated, and is a reference to the complex color pattern. The generic name Python was proposed by French naturalist François Marie Daudin in 1803. American zoologist Arnold G. Kluge performed a cladistics analysis on morphological characters and recovered the reticulated python lineage as sister to the genus Python, hence not requiring a new generic name in 1993.\n\nIn a 2004 genetics study using cytochrome b DNA, Robin Lawson and colleagues discovered the reticulated python as sister to Australo-Papuan pythons, rather than Python molurus and relatives. Raymond Hoser erected the genus Broghammerus for the reticulated python in 2004, naming it after German snake expert Stefan Broghammer, on the basis of dorsal patterns distinct from those of the genus Python, and a dark mid-dorsal line from the rear to the front of the head, and red or orange (rather than brown) iris colour. In 2008, Lesley H. Rawlings and colleagues reanalysed Kluge\'s morphological data and combined it with genetic material, finding the reticulated clade to be an offshoot of the Australo-Papuan lineage as well. They adopted and redefined the genus name Broghammerus.\n\nMost taxonomists choose to ignore Broghammerus and other names by Hoser as its description lacked scientific rigour and was not published in a reputable journal. R. Graham Reynolds and colleagues accordingly proposed the name Malayopython for this species and its sister species, the Timor python. Malayopython has been recognized by subsequent authors and the Reptile Database. Hoser has argued that Broghammerus was validly published and Malayopython name is invalid as it is a junior synonym. In 2021, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature found no basis for regarding the name Broghammerus to be invalid. Nevertheless, the name Malayopython remains in use by reliable sources.\n\nThree subspecies have been proposed:\n\nThe latter two are dwarf subspecies. Apparently, the population of the Sangihe Islands north of Sulawesi represents another such subspecies, which is basal to the P. r. reticulatus plus P. r. jampeanus clade, but it is not yet formally described.\n\nThe proposed subspecies M. r. "dalegibbonsi", M. r. "euanedwardsi", M. r. "haydnmacphiei", M. r. "neilsonnemani", M. r. "patrickcouperi", and M. r. "stuartbigmorei" have not found general acceptance.\n\nThe reticulated python has smooth dorsal scales that are arranged in 69–79 rows at midbody. Deep pits occur on four anterior upper labials, on two or three anterior lower labials, and on five or six posterior lower labials.\n\nThe reticulated python is the largest snake native to Asia. More than a thousand wild reticulated pythons in southern Sumatra were studied, and estimated to have a length range of 1.5 to 6.5\xa0m (4\xa0ft 11\xa0in to 21\xa0ft 4\xa0in), and a weight range of 1 to 75\xa0kg (2\xa0lb 3\xa0oz to 165\xa0lb 6\xa0oz). Reticulated pythons with lengths more than 6\xa0m (19\xa0ft 8\xa0in) are rare, though according to the Guinness Book of World Records, it is the only extant snake to regularly exceed that length. One of the largest scientifically measured specimens, from Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, was measured under anesthesia at 6.95\xa0m (22\xa0ft 10\xa0in) and weighed 59\xa0kg (130\xa0lb 1\xa0oz) after not having eaten for nearly 3 months.\n\nThe specimen once widely accepted as the largest-ever "accurately" measured snake, that being Colossus, a specimen kept at the Highland Park Zoo (now the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the 1950s and early 1960s, with a peak reported length of 8.7 metres (28\xa0ft 7\xa0in) from a measurement in November 1956, was later shown to have been substantially shorter than previously reported. When Colossus died on 14 April 1963, its body was deposited in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. At that time, its skeleton was measured and found to be 20\xa0ft 10\xa0in (6.35\xa0m) in total length, and the length of its fresh hide was measured as 23\xa0ft 11\xa0in (7.29\xa0m). The hide tends to stretch from the skinning process, thus may be longer than the snake from which it came – e.g., by roughly 20–40% or more. The previous reports had been constructed by combining partial measurements with estimations to compensate for "kinks", since completely straightening an extremely large live python is virtually impossible. Because of these issues, a 2012 journal article concluded, "Colossus was neither the longest snake nor the heaviest snake ever maintained in captivity." Too large to be preserved with formaldehyde and then stored in alcohol, the specimen was instead prepared as a disarticulated skeleton. The hide was sent to a laboratory to be tanned, but it was either lost or destroyed, and now only the skull and selected vertebrae and ribs remain in the museum\'s collection. Considerable confusion exists in the literature over whether Colossus was male or female (females tend to be larger).\nNumerous reports have been made of larger snakes, but since none of these was measured by a scientist nor any of the specimens deposited at a museum, they must be regarded as unproven and possibly erroneous. In spite of what has been, for many years, a standing offer of a large financial reward (initially $1,000, later raised to $5,000, then $15,000 in 1978 and $50,000 in 1980) for a live, healthy snake 30\xa0ft (9.14\xa0m) or longer by the New York Zoological Society (later renamed as the Wildlife Conservation Society), no attempt to claim this reward has ever been made.\n\nThe colour pattern is a complex geometric pattern that incorporates different colours. The back typically has a series of irregular diamond shapes flanked by smaller markings with light centers. In this species\' wide geographic range, much variation of size, colour, and markings commonly occurs.\n\nIn zoo exhibits, the colour pattern may seem garish, but in a shadowy jungle environment amid fallen leaves and debris, it allows them to virtually disappear. Called disruptive colouration, it protects them from predators and helps them to catch their prey.\n\nThe huge size and attractive pattern of this snake has made it a favorite zoo exhibit, with several individuals claimed to be above 20\xa0ft (6.1\xa0m) in length and more than one claimed to be the largest in captivity. However, due to its huge size, immense strength, aggressive disposition, and the mobility of the skin relative to the body, it is very difficult to get exact length measurements of a living reticulated python, and weights are rarely indicative, as captive pythons are often obese. Claims made by zoos and animal parks are sometimes exaggerated, such as the claimed 14.85\xa0m (48\xa0ft 9\xa0in) snake in Indonesia which was subsequently proven to be about 6.5–7\xa0m (21\xa0ft 4\xa0in\xa0– 23\xa0ft 0\xa0in) long. For this reason, scientists do not accept the validity of length measurements unless performed on a dead or anesthetized snake that is later preserved in a museum collection or stored for scientific research.\n\nA reticulated python kept in the United States in Kansas City, Missouri, named "Medusa" is considered by the Guinness Book of World Records to be the longest living snake ever kept in captivity. In 2011 it was reported to measure 7.67\xa0m (25\xa0ft 2\xa0in) and weigh 158.8\xa0kg (350\xa0lb 2\xa0oz).\n\nIn 2012, an albino reticulated python, named "Twinkie", housed in Fountain Valley, California, was considered to be the largest albino snake in captivity by the Guinness World Records. It measured 7\xa0m (23\xa0ft 0\xa0in) in length and weighed about 168\xa0kg (370\xa0lb).\n\nDwarf forms of reticulated pythons also occur, from some islands northwest of Australia, and these are being selectively bred in captivity to be much smaller, resulting in animals often referred to as "super dwarfs". Adult super dwarf reticulated pythons are typically between 1.82 and 2.4\xa0m (6\xa0ft 0\xa0in and 7\xa0ft 10\xa0in) in length.\n\nThe reticulated python is found in South and Southeast Asia from the Nicobar Islands, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore, east through Indonesia and the Indo-Australian Archipelago (Sumatra, the Mentawai Islands, the Natuna Islands, Borneo, Sulawesi, Java, Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores, Timor, Maluku, Tanimbar Islands) and the Philippines (Basilan, Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros, Palawan, Panay, Polillo, Samar, Tawi-Tawi). The original description does not include a type locality. The type locality was restricted to "Java" by Brongersma (1972).\n\nThree subspecies have been proposed, but are not recognized in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The color and size can vary a great deal among the subspecies described. Geographical location is a good key to establishing the subspecies, as each one has a distinct geographical range.\n\nThe reticulated python lives in rainforests, woodlands, and nearby grasslands. It is also associated with rivers and is found in areas with nearby streams and lakes. An excellent swimmer, it has even been reported far out at sea and has consequently colonized many small islands within its range. During the early years of the 20th century, it is said to have been common even in busy parts of Bangkok, sometimes eating domestic animals.\n\nAs with all pythons, the reticulated python is an ambush predator, usually waiting until prey wanders within strike range before seizing it in its coils and killing by constriction. Its natural diet includes mammals and occasionally birds. Small specimens up to 3–4\xa0m (9\xa0ft 10\xa0in\xa0– 13\xa0ft 1\xa0in) long eat mainly small mammals such as rats, other rodents, mouse-eared bats, and treeshrews, whereas larger individuals switch to prey such as small Indian civet and binturong, primates, pigs, and deer weighing more than 60\xa0kg (132\xa0lb 4\xa0oz). As a rule, the reticulated python seems able to swallow prey up to one-quarter its own length and up to its own weight. Near human habitation, it is known to snatch stray chickens, cats, and dogs on occasion.\nAmong the largest documented prey items are a half-starved sun bear of 23\xa0kg (50\xa0lb 11\xa0oz) that was eaten by a 6.95\xa0m (22\xa0ft 10\xa0in) specimen and took some 10 weeks to digest.\nAt least one case is reported of a foraging python entering a forest hut and taking a child.\n\nThe reticulated python is oviparous. Adult females lay between 15 and 80 eggs per clutch. At an optimum incubation temperature of 31–32\xa0°C (88–90\xa0°F), the eggs take an average of 88 days to hatch. Hatchlings are at least 0.61\xa0m (2\xa0ft) in length.\n\nThe reticulated python is among the few snakes that prey on humans, and is the only species of snake where video and photographic proof exists of them having consumed humans. In 2015, the species was added to the Lacey Act of 1900, prohibiting import and interstate transport due to its "injurious" history with humans. Attacks on humans in captivity are not common. Wild pythons, however, are known to sometimes prey on humans, particularly in their natural habitat in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Considering the known maximum prey size, a full-grown reticulated python can open its jaws wide enough to swallow a human, but the width of the shoulders of some adult Homo sapiens can pose a problem for even a snake with sufficient size. Reports of human fatalities and human consumption (the latest examples of consumption of an adult human being well authenticated) include:\n\nIncreased popularity of the reticulated python in the pet trade is due largely to increased efforts in captive breeding and selectively bred mutations such as the "albino" and "tiger" strains. Other notable color mutations recorded in this species include "sunfire", "motley", "Aztec", "ocelot", "rainbow", and "goldenchild". Some mutations, such as the "BEL" (black eyed leucistic) mutations are seldom bred due the discovery that they develop fatal gastrointestinal issues upon reaching adulthood. The "jaguar" color mutation is likewise controversial in the breeding of captive reticulated pythons, as certain specimens will develop neurological and osseous inner ears, similar to the "Spider" mutation that occurs in the ball python. It remains unclear as to why some individual pythons with the jaguar mutation display neurological issues associated with this genetic trait and others do not. Smaller animals such as the proposed "super dwarf" subspecies found on small islands are likewise popular due to their smaller size, as they grow to a fraction of the lengths and weights of their mainland kin due to genetics, limited space and prey availability. Dwarf and super dwarf reticulated pythons are likewise defined for captive animals as any reticulated pythons with at least 50 percent lineage hailing from seven select islands in the Selayer island chain near Sulawesi. It can make a good captive, but keepers working with adults from mainland populations should have previous experience with large constrictors to ensure safety to both animal and keeper. Although its interactivity and beauty draws much attention, some feel it is unpredictable. The python can bite and possibly constrict if it feels threatened, or mistakes a hand for food. While not venomous, large pythons can inflict serious injuries by biting, sometimes requiring stitches.'], 'score': 4.844592}, {'id': 'Rangifer_tarandus_dawsoni', 'name': ['Rangifer tarandus dawsoni'], 'introduction': ["\n\nThe Dawson's caribou, also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands caribou (Rangifer tarandus dawsoni) was a population of woodland caribou that once lived on Graham Island, the largest of the islands within the Haida Gwaii archipelago, located off the coast of British Columbia, Canada."], 'sections': ["The Haida Gwaii archipelago has been inhabited by indigenous people for thousands of years. Despite this, it is not reported that the indigenous population had much, if any, knowledge of the caribou, likely due to the two inhabiting different parts of Graham Island. The first known written record of the Dawson's caribou came from George Mercer Dawson, a member of the Geological Survey of Canada, who mentioned the animal in a 1878 report on the islands, initially mistaking it for a type of elk. Dawson eventually brought news of the caribou to Ernest Thompson Seton, an author and wildlife artist, who officially described the animal in 1900 and named it in Dawson's honour.\n\nThe subject of the coat colour of the Dawson's caribou is a matter of some contention. While often described as pale with few to no markings, which would be typical of an insular ungulate, this description is likely based on aged museum skins, as the remains of recently killed individuals photographed in 1908 appear darker in colour.\n\nThe Dawson's caribou is also described as smaller than its mainland counterpart, which is likely due to insular dwarfism, another trait common in insular ungulates.\n\nSome sources report both sexes as having antlers, while others state females were antlerless. In both cases, the antlers themselves are described as reduced in size, in comparison to mainland caribou, and remarkably abnormal in shape.\n\nThe Dawson's caribou was the largest herbivorous land mammal native to the Haida Gwaii archipelago. They were said to only be found on the plateau around Virago Sound, located in the north of the island, inhabiting muskegs and open woodland.\n\nThe only carnivore the caribou would have had to contend with would have been the Haida Gwaii black bear, which still survives on the islands today.\n\nOnce thought to represent a unique subspecies of woodland caribou, a 2002 study that analysed mtDNA found Dawson's caribou to not be genetically distinct from the subspecies on the Canadian mainland.\n\nGiven the small size and isolation of the Dawson's caribou population, even minor changes in their environment could have presented considerable pressure to their continued survival.\n\nThe introduction of black-tailed deer to Graham Island took place on multiple occasions between 1878 and 1925, and could have potentially played a role in the caribou's demise through competition for resources and the spread of disease. Clearcutting was occurring on the island around this time as well, and along with providing further feeding opportunities for the introduced black-tailed deer, which in turn helped bolster their numbers, it is possible the destruction of woodland negatively affected the caribou directly via habitat loss.\n\nDawson's caribou were hunted by both indigenous people and European settlers for their pelts, as part of the fur trade, which presented another threat to the population.\n\nThe last definite sighting of a live Dawson's caribou occurred on November 1, 1908, when a small group was observed, this included a pair of adult bulls, one cow and a calf. The animals showed little fear and stood quite still. One by one, except for the calf, all three animals were shot and killed. The orphaned calf meanwhile, was spared in the same year, but without the care of its parents, it died soon after. Their remains, one of which represents the only mounted specimen known to exist, now reside in the collection of the Royal BC Museum in Victoria.\n\nWhile caribou tracks were discovered as recently as 1935, the exact age of the hoof prints is not known, and it is likely the population was fully extirpated by the end of the decade, if not earlier."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 4.8354216}, {'id': 'Corvus_rhipidurus', 'name': ['Corvus rhipidurus'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe fan-tailed raven (Corvus rhipidurus) is a passerine bird of the crow family native to Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.'], 'sections': ['The fan-tailed raven is completely black including bill, legs and feet and the plumage has a purplish-blue gloss in good light.

It soars and plays in thermals even more so than other raven species and often associates with the brown-necked raven roosting in the same tree as it.\n\nThis species nests on rock ledges and in cavities in cliffs though very rarely in Somalia it has been known to nest in trees. There are usually 2–4 eggs laid. The great-spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius)  sometimes uses this species as a brood host.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 4.8236923}, {'id': 'Megawhaitsia_patrichae', 'name': ['Megawhaitsia patrichae'], 'introduction': ['\n\n\n\nMegawhaitsia is an extinct genus of large therocephalian therapsids who lived during the Late Permian (Wuchiapingian) in what is now Eastern Europe. The only known species is M. patrichae, described in 2008 from several fossils discovered in various oblasts of European Russia. The fossils are representative of a large animal whose skull size is estimated to be 40–50\xa0cm (16–20\xa0in) long.\n\nThe most notable feature of Megawhaitsia is that it has a maxilla with canals directly connected to the tooth root of the canines. Based on the characteristics present in the related genus Euchambersia, Russian paleontologist Mikhail Ivakhnenko raises the possibility that the animal may have had a venom gland. If it is true, then it would then be one of the oldest tetrapods known to have this attribute. Subsequent studies have challenged this proposition.\n\nThe imposing size of Megawhaitsia and its position as an apex predator could be linked to the disappearance or absence of large gorgonopsians at the end of the Late Permian in certain regions of present-day European Russia. Megawhaitsia could thus have occupied the ecological niches previously occupied by the gorgonopsians.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The holotype specimen of Megawhaitsia was discovered in the mid-1950s during excavations carried out in the locality of Vyazniki-2, located in Vladimir Oblast, in European Russia, before being cataloged as PIN 1100/101. This site is dated to the Wuchiapingian stage of the Late Permian. It had originally been incorrectly recorded as the jawbone of a gorgonopsian similar to Inostrancevia. Given the low presence of gorgonopsians during the Late Permian in Russia, the fossil was reassigned to a large therocephalian in a work published in 1997, without however receiving a binomial name. In 2001, Mikhail Feodosievich Ivakhnenko attributed two additional fossil remains to the still unnamed taxon. The first is a partial maxillary bone, cataloged PIN 1538/39, discovered in the locality of Purly, in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. The second is the right part of an incomplete mandible, cataloged PIN 4417/101, discovered in the locality of Shabarshata, in the Kirov Oblast.\n\nIvakhnenko published in 2008 a formal description of the new taxa, based on the specimens PIN 1100/101 and PIN 1538/39, describing it as the first Late Permian whaitsiid from Eastern Europe. Subsequently, the scope of whaitsiids was expanded to include discoveries made earlier in the Permian deposits of the same Russian regions, including Moschowhaitsia and Viatkosuchus, described in 1963 and 1995 respectively. The genus name Megawhaitsia comes from the Ancient Greek μέγας (megas, "great"), combined with the name of another therocephalian genus, Whaitsia (name witch is today synonymous with Theriognathus). The specific epithet patrichae honors the Australian paleontologist Patricia Vickers-Rich.\n\nThe known fossils of Megawhaitsia are very incomplete, thus preventing any complete reconstruction of the animal\'s anatomy. However, the structure of the two known maxillary bones proves that it is a therocephalian.\n\nThe animals\' maxillary bone was massive with the largest preserved fragment measuring about 10\xa0cm (3.9\xa0in) in length. Based on the proportions of the fuller skulls of the smaller South African representatives of the group, the total length of the animal\'s skull is estimated to be between 40–50\xa0cm (16–20\xa0in), which would make Megawhaitsia the largest therocephalian known to date. On the lower edge of the maxilla there is a large space that can accommodate the lower canine. Behind are the sockets of three large upper canines, the two anterior being somewhat larger. The roots of the teeth are deep, all three having a deep alveolar fossa. The partial mandible attributed to Megawhaitsia has the socket of a very large canine but lacks those of the cheek teeth.\n\nA feature of the maxillary bone is that it has three channels which start in the region of the lacrimo-nasal duct, pass along the roots of the teeth and open near the sockets of each of the canines. By analogy with the hypotheses on the venomousness of another genus of therocephalians, Euchambersia, Ivakhnenko interprets these canals as a possible proof of the presence of poisonous glands in Megawhaitsia, which would be used to slaughter large prey. However, since the venomousness of Euchambersia has been questioned in a study published in 2017, in particular on the basis of the comparison with various modern venomous animals, the authors of the 2017 study suggest other explanations of the presence of these maxillary canals might be possible.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the fossil maxillary bones of Megawhaitsia were considered to belong to a gorgonopsid similar or identical to the genus Inostrancevia. In 1997, the fossils were reassigned to an undetermined therocephalian in the family Whaitsiidae, then to the Moschorhinidae family in 2001. In the 2008 article of Ivakhnenko, Megawhaitsia is included again in the family Whaitsiidae, within the superfamily Whaitsioidea. At that time, the Whaitsioidea taxon included the Euchambersiidae and the Whaitsiidae as sister-groups, due to their similar appearance. A study published less than a year later by Adam Huttenlocker estimated that the families Euchambersiidae, Moschorhinidae and Annatherapsididae represented junior synonyms of Akidnognathidae, considered the sister-group of Whaitsiidae. It was in 2016 that Huttenlocker and Christian Sidor concluded that the Akidnognathidae are in fact close to the Chthonosauridae, the two forming the sister-group of a clade containing the Whaitsioidea and the Baurioidea. The superfamily Whaitsioidea remains recognized as a valid taxa, although it now only contains whaitsiids and a few related genera.\n\nIn comparison to South African therocephalians, Megawhaitsia had a noticeably larger size corresponding to a specialized carnivorous predator niche. It fed on fairly large prey, notably dicynodonts, which were numerous in Russian regions of Europe during the Upper Permian. The possible presence of venom glands in Megawhaitsia would be consistent with the warm-blooded dicynodont hypothesis, as venom offers a significant advantage especially in hunting active warm-blooded prey.\n\nOne of the types of large coprolites found in the Vyazniki locality is associated with Megawhaitsia or closely related whaitsiids such as Moschowhaitsia. It reveals a high content of bony material, including bones bearing traces of a rich network of blood vessels, probably belonging to dicynodonts, indicating a predator that occupied the top position in the trophic chain. Additionally, remains of fish scales and material interpreted as ganoine have been found in morphotype A coprolites, as well as fur-like structures. These are interpreted as the oldest fossil coat remains known to date, although it remains unclear whether they belong to prey or were swallowed by a predator as a result of grooming.\n\nThe locality of Viazniki-2, where the holotype of Megawhaitsia was discovered, contains numerous fossils of tetrapods dating from the Wuchiapingian, including the temnospondyl Dvinosaurus, as well as non-amniote reptiliomorphs, including the seymouriamorph Karpinskiosaurus and numerous chroniosuchians. Sauropsids present include pareiasaurs such as Obirkovia and archosauriforms of the family Proterosuchidae, such as Archosaurus. The latter would also have been one of the main predators of the area. Other therapsids are present in the locality, such as an indeterminate dicynodont and even other therocephalians, including Annatherapsidus, Malasaurus and Moschowhaitsia.\n\nResearchers speculate that due to their increased size, East European whaitsiids occupied the ecological niche of the large gorgonopsians, which at that time had disappeared from Eastern Europe, possibly due to a climate cooling.'], 'score': 4.813699}, {'id': 'Choloepus_hoffmanni', 'name': ['Choloepus hoffmanni'], 'introduction': ["\n\nThe Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni), also known as the northern two-toed sloth, is a species of sloth from Central and South America. It is a solitary, largely nocturnal and arboreal animal, found in mature and secondary rainforests and deciduous forests. The common name commemorates the German naturalist Karl Hoffmann."], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['Hoffmann\'s two-toed sloth is a heavily built animal with shaggy fur and slow, deliberate movements. The fore feet have only two toes, each ending with long, curved claws, although three clawed toes are on each of the hind feet. Other features that distinguish it from three-toed sloths, which may be found in the same geographic areas, include the longer snout, separate rather than partially fused toes of the forefeet, the absence of hair on the soles of the feet, and larger overall size. The wrist of the sloth has developed some specific traits due to their slow, yet acrobatic motions.  These evolved traits include diminution and distal migration of the pisiform bone, with a loss of contact with the ulna; reduction of the distal end of the ulna to a styloid process; and extremely reduced contact between the ulna and triquetral bone.\n\nHoffmann\'s two-toed sloth is, however, much easier to confuse with the related Linnaeus\'s two-toed sloth, which it closely resembles. The primary physical differences between the two species relate to subtle skeletal features; for example, Hoffmann\'s two-toed sloth has three foramina in the upper forward part of the interpterygoid space, rather than just two, and often – but not always – has fewer cervical vertebrae.\n\nAdults range from 54 to 72\xa0cm (21 to 28\xa0in) in head-body length, and weigh from 2.1 to 9\xa0kg (4.6 to 19.8\xa0lb). Although they do have stubby tails, just 1.5 to 3\xa0cm (0.59 to 1.18\xa0in) long, this is too short to be visible through the long fur. The claws are 5 to 6.5\xa0cm (2.0 to 2.6\xa0in) long. Females are larger on average than males, although with considerable overlap in size. Their fur is tan to light brown in colour, being lighter on the face, but usually has a greenish tinge because of the presence of algae living in the hairs.\n\nIts karyotype has 2n = 49–51 and FN = 61.\n\nHoffmann\'s two-toed sloth inhabits tropical forests from sea level to 3,300\xa0m (10,800\xa0ft) above sea level. It is found in the rainforest canopy in two separate regions of Central and South America, separated by the Andes. One population is found from eastern Honduras in the north to western Ecuador in the south, and the other in eastern Peru, western Brazil, and northern Bolivia. Based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences, a divergence date of about 7 million years between these populations has been suggested. Two-toed sloths live in the canopies in the forests of the tropical rainforests.\xa0 They usually tend to be relaxing in the branches of the trees that are intertwined within each other throughout the sheltering treetops.\xa0 Most of the two-toed sloths activity takes place hanging upside down but when it comes time for urination and defecation they make their way to the ground.\xa0These creatures also come to the ground when in need of a new tree to live upon or to discover a new food source.\n\nThe five recognised subspecies of C. hoffmanni are:\n\nTwo-toed sloths spend most of their time in trees, though they may travel on the ground to move to a new tree. A study of sloths on Barro Colorado Island indicated that the Hoffmann\'s two-toed sloths there were almost exclusively nocturnal, even though in other locations they are known to be active during day.  The authors attributed this in part to competition with the brown-throated sloth.  They often move slowly through the canopy for about eight hours each night, and spend much of the day sleeping in tangles of lianas. They move only very slowly, typically at around 0.14\xa0m/s (0.46\xa0ft/s), although they can move up to 50% faster when excited. They are solitary in the wild, and, aside from mothers with young, it is unusual for two to be found in a tree at the same time.\n\nThe name "sloth" means "lazy", but the slow movements of this animal are actually an adaptation for surviving on a low-energy diet of leaves. These sloths have half the metabolic rate of a typical mammal of the same size. Despite their low metabolic rates, two-toed sloths physiologically respond to hypoxia and hypercapnia similarly to other mammals with higher metabolic rates. Sloths have very poor eyesight and hearing, and rely almost entirely on their senses of touch and smell to find food.[citation needed]\n\nThis species often exhibits exaggerated wobbling of the head. Another trait of this sloth is it often spits when the mouth opens. The saliva often accumulates on the lower lip, giving the creature a comical appearance.[citation needed]\n\nTwo-toed sloths hang from tree branches, suspended by their huge, hook-like claws. The clinging behaviour is a reflex action, and sloths are found still hanging from trees after they die. The sloth spends almost its entire life, including eating, sleeping, mating, and giving birth, hanging upside down from tree branches. Usually, sloths are found right side up when they descend to the ground to defecate, which they usually do about once every three to eight days.  They will also ground themselves to urinate, change trees if they wish, or mate, as well as give birth.  While terrestrial locomotion is usually thought to involve the sloth lying on the ground and pulling themselves forward, they have actually been seen walking on their palms and soles.\n\nSloths descend about once every eight days to defecate on the ground. The reason and mechanism behind this behavior have long been debated among scientists. There are at least five hypotheses: 1) fertilize trees when feces are deposited at the base of the tree; 2) cover feces and avoid predation; 3) chemical communication between individuals; 4) pick up trace nutrients in their claws, that are then ingested and 5) favor a mutualistic relationship with populations of fur moths. More recently, a new hypothesis has emerged, which presents evidence against the previous ones and proposes that all current sloths are descendants from species that defecated on the ground, and there simply has not been enough selective pressure to abandon this behavior, since cases of predation during defecation are actually very rare.\n\nSloths have many predators, including the jaguars,  cougars, ocelots, harpy eagles, margays, and anacondas. If threatened, sloths can defend themselves by slashing out at a predator with their huge claws or biting with their canines. However, a sloth\'s main defense is to avoid being attacked in the first place. The two-toed sloth can survive wounds that would be fatal to another mammal its size. The sloth\'s slow, deliberate movements and algae-covered fur make them difficult for predators to spot from a distance. Their treetop homes are also out of reach for many larger predators.[citation needed]\n\nTheir long, coarse fur also protects them from sun and rain. Their fur, unlike other mammals, flows from belly to top, not top to belly, allowing rainwater to slide off the fur while the animal is hanging upside down.[citation needed]\n\nHoffmann\'s two-toed sloth inhabits a range of different trees within its habitat, although it seems to prefer those with plentiful lianas and direct sunlight. They have a typical home range of about 2 to 4\xa0ha (4.9 to 9.9 acres), and may spend most of their lives travelling between just 25 or so trees.\n\nCourtship consists of the female licking the male\'s face and rubbing her genitals against the male\'s body. Gestation lasts between 355 and 377 days, and results in the birth of a single young.  The birth takes place on either the ground or in the hanging position. Newborn sloths weigh 340 to 454\xa0g (12.0 to 16.0\xa0oz), and are precocial, already possessing long claws and able to cling to their mothers\' undersides. They begin to take solid food at 15 to 27 days, and are fully weaned by 9 weeks. Although relatively quiet as adults, young sloths make loud bleating alarm calls if separated from their mothers.\n\nIn captivity, the two-toed sloth was seen giving birth by hanging upside down and attempting to pull the infant between her hind limbs and onto her abdomen.  Other sloths were seen hanging under the mother and infant to protect the infant from falling.\n\nHoffmann\'s two-toed sloths reach sexual maturity at two to four years of age and have been reported to live up to 43 years in captivity.\n\nThough two-toed sloths also eat buds, tender twigs, young plant shoots, fruits and flowers, most of their diets consist of tree leaves. They use their lips to tear off their food and chew with their peg-like teeth which have no enamel and are always growing. Additionally, they have been observed using mineral licks, which can provide them with essential nutrients.\n\nDue to their low concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol, it is believed that two-toed sloths cannot synthesize vitamin D through skin contact with sunlight. They make up for this lack of synthesis through their diet.\n\nAlthough they are not true ruminants, sloths have three-chambered stomachs. The first two chambers hold symbiotic bacteria to help them digest the cellulose in their fibre-rich diets, while only the third chamber contains digestive glands typical of the stomachs of most other mammals. A sloth may take up to a month to completely digest a meal, and up to two-thirds of a sloth\'s weight may be the leaves in its digestive system.[citation needed]\n\nHabitat destruction is probably causing a decrease in the wild Hoffmann\'s two-toed sloth population, but little reliable data is available on the number of wild individuals. Sloths and people have little contact with one another in the wild.\n\nThe reproduction process of the two-toed sloths has some differences when compared to the three-toed sloths. Two toed sloths tend to mate all year around; they do not really go by a schedule. Typically, mating occurs during the rainy season and birth during the dry season. The female carries the baby for typically 11.5 months. Sloths do not tend to have one life long breeding partner. When the females are ready to mate, they let out a loud scream which attracts the males; if numerous males are ready to mate, they fight each other; after done mating, the male will usually leave. One factor that might explain this difference is that in some places, female sloths congregate around small, heterogeneously distributed habitats, allowing dominant males to gain mating access with multiple females with relatively little risk and effort. The female is the one who solely takes care of the baby sloth until they are independent and do not need the mother anymore. For the first 6–9 months of birth, mother sloth is carrying the baby and nurturing it until they are capable of being on their own. Sloths are sexually matured by the age 3 and are ready to start reproducing of their own.\n\nSloths are known to be heterothermic.\xa0Their body temperature ranges 86–93\xa0°F (30–34\xa0°C), which, compared to other mammals, is on the cold side.\xa0Having these low temperatures helps the sloths conserve their energy. Sloths\' fur is grown specifically for a job which is to grow algae.\xa0The algae grow within their hair shaft and benefits the creatures\' camouflaging techniques. The hair grows in a special system of being parted along the stomach and flows from belly to back; this is useful for when sloths are hanging upside down and the rainwater can run off.'], 'score': 4.8074846}, {'id': 'Nimiokoala', 'name': ['Nimiokoala'], 'introduction': ['\n\nNimiokoala greystanesi is an extinct marsupial, closely related to the extant koala, that inhabited northwestern Queensland in the early-middle Miocene (23–16\xa0million years ago).

To date, a partial skull has been found along with several lower jaws and isolated teeth.  On the basis of these fossils, the dental apparatus of the animal has been completely restored. The species was named in 1997 with Queensland Museum specimen "QMF30482" being designated the holotype; with the specimens used by the type description being part of the Queensland Museum collections.\n\nIn the absence of postcranial fossils, the size of Nimiokoala has been estimated from measurements of its surviving teeth. It is estimated to have body length of about 25–30\xa0cm (9.8-11.8\xa0in), and a weight of about 3.5\xa0kg (7.7\xa0lb), one third the size of modern koalas and more than 10 times smaller than the largest known representative of Phascolarctidae (Phascolarctos yorkensis). Its muzzle was more prominent than that of modern koalas, resembling the possum snout. The teeth of the Riversleigh rainforest koala are selenodontal (crescent-shaped), with a numerous cusps and accessory shearing blades. The fossilized skull contains large orbits and very large auditory bulliae relative to its size.\n\nIn the early-middle Miocene, Riversleigh was covered with tropical forests. More open areas, with karst soil, occurred at forest edges or freshwater streams and lakes. As the climate became more arid, with a more pronounced change of seasons, small species of koalas died out, including the Riversleigh rainforest koala.\n\nThe small size of Nimiokoala, which requires a proportionately more intensive diet, and large eye sockets, which indicate good night vision, suggest that this animal was much more mobile than the modern koala.  The structure of the ear of Nimikoala corresponds to that which can be observed in modern koalas; in conjunction with the large auditory bulliae, it can be concluded that the Riversleigh rainforest koala was sensitive to and used low-frequency sounds for communication, including to attract mates.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 4.799074}, {'id': 'Rhincodon_typus', 'name': ['Rhincodon typus'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of 18.8\xa0m (61.7\xa0ft). The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the most massive living non-cetacean animal. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae, which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into Rhinodontidae.\n\nWhale sharks inhabit the open waters of all tropical oceans. They are rarely found in water below 21\xa0°C (70\xa0°F). Whale sharks\' lifespans are estimated to be between 80 and 130 years, based on studies of their vertebral growth bands and the growth rates of free-swimming sharks. Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes and pose no threat to humans.\n\nThe species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4.6\xa0m (15\xa0ft) specimen in Table Bay, South Africa. Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town, described it the following year. The name "whale shark" refers to the animal\'s appearance and large size; it is a fish, not a mammal, and (like all sharks) is not closely related to whales. In addition, its filter feeding habits are similar to baleen whales.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['Whale sharks possess a broad, flattened head with a large mouth and two small eyes located at the front corners. Unlike many other sharks, whale shark mouths are located at the front of the head rather than on the underside of the head. A 12.1\xa0m (39.7\xa0ft) whale shark was reported to have a mouth 1.55\xa0m (5.1\xa0ft) across. Whale shark mouths can contain over 300 rows of tiny teeth and 20 filter pads which it uses to filter feed. The spiracles are located just behind the eyes. Whale sharks have five large pairs of gills. Their skin is dark grey with a white belly marked with an arrangement of pale grey or white spots and stripes that is unique to each individual. The skin can be up to 15\xa0cm (5.9\xa0in) thick and is very hard and rough to the touch. The whale shark has three prominent ridges along its sides, which start above and behind the head and end at the caudal peduncle. The shark has two dorsal fins set relatively far back on the body, a pair of pectoral fins, a pair of pelvic fins and a single medial anal fin. The caudal fin has a larger upper lobe than the lower lobe (heterocercal).\n\nWhale sharks have been found to possess dermal denticles on the surface of their eyeballs that are structured differently from their body denticles. The dermal denticles, as well as the whale shark\'s ability to retract its eyes deep into their sockets, serve to protect the eyes from damage.\n\nEvidence suggests that whale sharks can recover from major injuries and may be able to regenerate small sections of their fins. Their spot markings have also been shown to reform over a previously wounded area.\n\nThe complete and annotated genome of the whale shark was published in 2017.\n\nRhodopsin, the light-sensing pigment in the rod cells of the retina, is normally sensitive to green and used to see in dim light, but in the whale shark (and the bottom-dwelling cloudy catshark) two amino acid substitutions make the pigment more sensitive to blue light instead, the light that dominates the deep ocean. One of these mutations also makes rhodopsin vulnerable to higher temperatures. In humans, a similar mutation leads to congenital stationary night blindness, as the human body temperature makes the pigment decay. This pigment becomes unstable in shallow water, where the temperature is higher and the full spectrum of light is present. To protect from this instability, the whale shark deactivates the pigment when in shallow water (as otherwise the pigment would hinder full color vision). In the colder environment at 2,000 meters below the surface where the shark dives, it is activated again. The mutations thus allow the shark to see well at both ends of its great vertical range. The eyes have also lost all cone opsins except LWS.\n\nThe whale shark is the largest non-cetacean animal in the world. Evidence suggests that whale sharks exhibit sexual dimorphism with regards to size, with females growing larger than males. A 2020 study looked at the growth of whale shark individuals over a 10-year period. It concluded that males on average reach 8 to 9 meters (26 to 30\xa0ft) in length. The same study predicted females to reach a length of around 14.5\xa0m (48\xa0ft) on average, based on more limited data. However, these are averages and do not represent the maximum possible sizes. Previous studies estimating the growth and longevity of whale sharks have produced estimates ranging from 14 to 21.9 meters (46 to 72\xa0ft) in length. Limited evidence, mostly from males, suggests that sexual maturity occurs around 8 to 9 meters (26 to 30\xa0ft) in length, with females possibly maturing at a similar size or larger. The maximum length of the species is uncertain due to a lack of detailed documentation of the largest reported individuals. Several whale sharks around 18\xa0m (59\xa0ft) in length have been reported.\n\nLarge whale sharks are difficult to measure accurately, both on the land and in the water. When on land, the total length measurement can be affected by how the tail is positioned, either angled as it would be in life or stretched as far as possible. Historically, techniques such as comparisons to objects of known size and knotted ropes have been used for in-water measurements, but these techniques may be inaccurate. In 2011, laser photogrammetry was proposed to improve the accuracy of in-water measurements.\n\nSince the 1800s, there have been accounts of very large whale sharks. Some of these are as follows:\n\nIn 1868, the Irish natural scientist Edward Perceval Wright obtained several small whale shark specimens in the Seychelles. Wright was informed of one whale shark that was measured as exceeding 45\xa0ft (14\xa0m). Wright claimed to have observed specimens over 50\xa0ft (15\xa0m) and was told of specimens upwards of 70\xa0ft (21\xa0m).\n\nHugh M. Smith described a huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919. The shark was too heavy to pull ashore, and no measurements were taken. Smith learned through independent sources that it was at least 10 wa (a Thai unit of length measuring between a person\'s outstretched arms). Smith noted that one wa could be interpreted as either 2\xa0m (6.6\xa0ft) or the approximate average of 1.7\xa0to 1.8\xa0m (5.6–5.9\xa0ft), based on the local fishermen. Later sources have stated this whale shark as approximately 18\xa0m (59\xa0ft), but the accuracy of the estimate has been questioned.\n\nIn 1934, a ship named the Maunganui came across a whale shark in the southern Pacific Ocean and rammed it. The shark became stuck on the prow of the ship, supposedly with 15\xa0ft (4.6\xa0m) on one side and 40\xa0ft (12.2\xa0m) on the other, suggesting a total length of about 55\xa0ft (17\xa0m).\n\nScott A. Eckert & Brent S. Stewart reported on satellite tracking of whale sharks from between 1994 and 1996. Out of the 15 individuals tracked, two females were reported as measuring 15\xa0m (49\xa0ft) and 18\xa0m (59\xa0ft) respectively. A 20.75\xa0m (68.1\xa0ft) long whale shark was reported as being stranded along the Ratnagiri coast in 1995. A female individual with a standard length of 15\xa0m (49.2\xa0ft) and an estimated total length at 18.8\xa0m (61.7\xa0ft) was reported from the Arabian Sea in 2001. In a 2015 study looking into the size of marine megafauna, McClain and colleagues considered this female as being the most reliable and accurately measured.\n\nOn 7 February 2012, a large whale shark was found floating 150 kilometres (93\xa0mi) off the coast of Karachi, Pakistan. The length of the specimen was said to be between 11 and 12\xa0m (36 and 39\xa0ft), with a weight of around 15,000\xa0kg (33,000\xa0lb).\n\nThe whale shark inhabits all tropical and warm-temperate seas. The fish is primarily pelagic, and can be found in both coastal and oceanic habitats. Tracking devices have shown that the whale shark displays dynamic patterns of habitat utilization, likely in response to availability of prey. Whale sharks observed off the northeast Yucatan Peninsula tend to engage in inshore surface swimming between sunrise and mid-afternoon, followed by regular vertical oscillations in oceanic waters during the afternoon and overnight. About 95% of the oscillating period was spent in epipelagic depths (<200 metres (660\xa0ft)), but whale sharks also took regular deep dives (>500 metres (1,600\xa0ft)), often descending in brief "stutter steps", perhaps for foraging. The deepest recorded dive was 1,928 metres (6,325\xa0ft), making the whale shark the deepest diving fish to be recorded. Whale sharks were also observed to remain continuously at depths of greater than 50 metres (160\xa0ft) for three days or more.\n\nThe whale shark is migratory and has two distinct subpopulations: an Atlantic subpopulation, from Maine and the Azores to Cape Agulhas, South Africa, and an Indo-Pacific subpopulation which holds 75% of the entire whale shark population. It usually roams between 30°N and 35°S where water temperatures are higher than 21\xa0°C (70\xa0°F) but have been spotted as far north as the Bay of Fundy, Canada and the Sea of Okhotsk north of Japan and as far south as Victoria, Australia.\n\nSeasonal feeding aggregations occur at several coastal sites such as the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia, Darwin Island in the Galápagos, Quintana Roo in Mexico, Mafia Island of Pwani Region in Tanzania, Inhambane province in Mozambique, the Philippines, around Mahe in the Seychelles, the Gujarat and Kerala coasts of India, Taiwan, southern China and Qatar.\n\nIn 2011, more than 400 whale sharks gathered off the Yucatan Coast. It was one of the largest gatherings of whale sharks recorded. Aggregations in that area are among the most reliable seasonal gatherings known for whale sharks, with large numbers occurring in most years between May and September. Associated ecotourism has grown rapidly to unsustainable levels.\n\nGrowth, longevity, and reproduction of the whale shark are poorly understood. There was uncertainty as to whether vertebrae growth bands are formed annually or biannually, which is important in determining the age, growth, and longevity of whale sharks. A 2020 study compared the ratio of Carbon-14 isotopes found in growth bands of whale shark vertebrae to nuclear testing events in the 1950-60s, finding that growth bands are laid down annually. The study found an age of 50 years for a 10\xa0m (33\xa0ft) female and 35 years for a 9.9m male. Various studies looking at vertebrae growth bands and measuring whale sharks in the wild have estimated their lifespans from ~80 years and up to ~130 years.\n\nEvidence suggests that males grow faster than females in the earlier stages of life but ultimately reach a smaller maximum size. Whale sharks exhibit late sexual maturity. One study looking at free-swimming whale sharks estimated the age at maturity in males at ~25 years.\n\nPupping of whale sharks has not been observed, but mating has been witnessed twice in St Helena. Mating in this species was filmed for the first time in whale sharks off Ningaloo Reef via airplane in Australia in 2019, when a larger male unsuccessfully attempted to mate with a smaller, immature female.\n\nThe capture of a ~10.6\xa0m (35\xa0ft) female in July 1996 that was pregnant with ~300 pups indicated that whale sharks are ovoviviparous. The eggs remain in the body and the females give birth to live young which are 40 to 60\xa0cm (16 to 24\xa0in) long. Evidence indicates the pups are not all born at once, but rather the female retains sperm from one mating and produces a steady stream of pups over a prolonged period.\n\nOn 7 March 2009, marine scientists in the Philippines discovered what is believed to be the smallest living specimen of the whale shark. The young shark, measuring only 38\xa0cm (15\xa0in), was found with its tail tied to a stake at a beach in Pilar, Sorsogon, Philippines, and was released into the wild. Based on this discovery, some scientists no longer believe this area is just a feeding ground; this site may be a birthing ground, as well. Both young whale sharks and pregnant females have been seen in the waters of St Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, where numerous whale sharks can be spotted during the summer.\n\nIn a report from Rappler last August 2019, whale sharks were sighted during WWF Philippines\' photo identification activities in the first half of the year. There were a total 168 sightings – 64 of them “re-sightings” or reappearances of previously recorded whale sharks. WWF noted that “very young whale shark juveniles" were identified among the 168 individuals spotted in the first half of 2019. Their presence suggests that the Ticao Pass may be a pupping ground for whale sharks, further increasing the ecological significance of the area.\n\nThe whale shark is a filter feeder – one of only three known filter-feeding shark species (along with the basking shark and the megamouth shark). It feeds on plankton including copepods, krill, fish eggs, Christmas Island red crab larvae and small nektonic life, such as small squid or fish. It also feeds on clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals. The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding. Feeding occurs either by ram filtration, in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward, pushing water and food into the mouth, or by active suction feeding, in which the animal opens and closes its mouth, sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills. In both cases, the filter pads serve to separate food from water. These unique, black sieve-like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers. Food separation in whale sharks is by cross-flow filtration, in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface, not perpendicularly through it, before passing to the outside, while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat. This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimizes fouling of the filter pad surface. Whale sharks have been observed "coughing", presumably to clear a build-up of particles from the filter pads. Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed.\n\nThe whale shark is an active feeder, targeting concentrations of plankton or fish. It is able to ram filter feed or can gulp in a stationary position. This is in contrast to the passive feeding basking shark, which does not pump water. Instead, it swims to force water across its gills.\n\nA juvenile whale shark is estimated to eat 21\xa0kg (46 pounds) of plankton per day.\n\nThe BBC program Planet Earth filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish. The same documentary showed footage of a whale shark timing its arrival to coincide with the mass spawning of fish shoals and feeding on the resultant clouds of eggs and sperm.\n\nWhale sharks are known to prey on a range of planktonic and small nektonic organisms that are spatiotemporally patchy. These include krill, crab larvae, jellyfish, sardines, anchovies, mackerels, small tunas, and squid. In ram filter feeding, the fish swims forward at constant speed with its mouth fully open, straining prey particles from the water by forward propulsion. This is also called ‘passive feeding’, which usually occurs when prey is present at low density.\n\nDue their mode of feeding, whale sharks are susceptible to the ingestion of microplastics. As such, the presence of microplastics in whale shark scat was recently confirmed.\n\nDespite its size, the whale shark does not pose any danger to humans. Younger whale sharks are gentle and can play with divers. Underwater photographers such as Fiona Ayerst have photographed them swimming close to humans without any danger.  Although whale sharks are docile fish, touching or riding the sharks is strictly forbidden and fineable in most countries, as it can cause serious harm to the animal.\n\nThe shark is seen by divers in many places, including the Bay Islands in Honduras, Thailand, Indonesia (Bone Bolango, Cendrawasih Bay), the Philippines, the Maldives close to Maamigili (South Ari Atoll), the Red Sea, Western Australia (Ningaloo Reef, Christmas Island), Taiwan, Panama (Coiba Island), Belize, Tofo Beach in Mozambique, Sodwana Bay (Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park) in South Africa, the Galapagos Islands, Saint Helena, Isla Mujeres (Caribbean Sea), La Paz, Baja California Sur and Bahía de los Ángeles in Mexico, the Seychelles, West Malaysia, islands off eastern peninsular Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Oman, Fujairah, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the Caribbean. Juveniles can be found near the shore in the Gulf of Tadjoura, near Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa.\n\nThere is currently no robust estimate of the global whale shark population. The species is considered endangered by the IUCN due to the impacts of fisheries, by-catch losses, and vessel strikes, combined with its long lifespan and late maturation. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the whale shark as "Migrant" with the qualifier "Secure Overseas" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.\n\nIt is listed, along with six other species of sharks, under the CMS Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. In 1998, the Philippines banned all fishing, selling, importing, and exporting of whale sharks for commercial purposes, followed by India in May 2001 and Taiwan in May 2007.\n\nIn 2010, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill resulted in 4,900,000 barrels (780,000\xa0m3) of oil flowing into an area south of the Mississippi River Delta, where one-third of all whale shark sightings in the northern part of the gulf have occurred in recent years. Sightings confirmed that the whale sharks were unable to avoid the oil slick, which was situated on the surface of the sea where the whale sharks feed for several hours at a time. No dead whale sharks were found.\n\nThis species was also added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2003 to regulate the international trade of live specimens and its parts.\n\nIt was reported in 2014 that hundreds of whale sharks were illegally killed every year in China for their fins, skins, and oil.\n\nThe whale shark is popular in the few public aquariums that keep it, but its large size means that a very large tank is required and it has specialized feeding requirements. Their large size and iconic status have also fueled an opposition to keeping the species in captivity, especially after the early death of some whale sharks in captivity and certain Chinese aquariums keeping the species in relatively small tanks.\n\nThe first attempt at keeping whale sharks in captivity was in 1934 when an individual was kept for about four months in a netted-off natural bay in Izu, Japan. The first attempt of keeping whale sharks in an aquarium was initiated in 1980 by the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium (then known as Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium) in Japan. Since 1980, several have been kept at Okinawa, mostly obtained from incidental catches in coastal nets set by fishers (none after 2009), but two were strandings. Several of these were already weak from the capture/stranding and some were released, but initial captive survival rates were low. After the initial difficulties in maintaining the species had been resolved, some have survived long-term in captivity. The record for a whale shark in captivity is an individual that, as of 2021, has lived for more than 26 years in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium from Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium. Following Okinawa, Osaka Aquarium started keeping whale sharks and most of the basic research on the keeping of the species was made at these two institutions.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, several other aquariums have kept the species in Japan (Kagoshima Aquarium, Kinosaki Marine World, Notojima Aquarium, Oita Marine Palace Aquarium, and Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise), South Korea (Aqua Planet Jeju), China (Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, Dalian Aquarium, Guangzhou Aquarium in Guangzhou Zoo, Qingdao Polar Ocean World and Yantai Aquarium), Taiwan (National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium), India (Thiruvananthapuram Aquarium) and Dubai (Atlantis, The Palm), with some maintaining whale sharks for years and others only for a very short period. The whale shark kept at Dubai\'s Atlantis, The Palm was rescued from shallow waters in 2008 with extensive abrasions to the fins and after rehabilitation it was released in 2010, having lived 19 months in captivity. Marine Life Park in Singapore had planned on keeping whale sharks but scrapped this idea in 2009.\n\nOutside Asia, the first and so far only place to keep whale sharks is Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, United States. This is unusual because of the comparatively long transport time and complex logistics required to bring the sharks to the aquarium, ranging between 28 and 36 hours. Georgia keeps two whale sharks: two males, Taroko and Yushan, who both arrived in 2007. Two earlier males at Georgia Aquarium, Ralph and Norton, both died in 2007. Trixie died in 2020. Alice died in 2021. Georgia\'s whale sharks were all imported from Taiwan and were taken from the commercial fishing quota for the species, usually used locally for food. Taiwan closed this fishery entirely in 2008.\n\nIn Madagascar, whale sharks are called marokintana in Malagasy, meaning "many stars", after the appearance of the markings on the shark\'s back.\n\nIn the Philippines, it is called butanding and balilan. The whale shark is featured on the reverse of the Philippine 100-peso bill. By law snorkelers must maintain a distance of 4\xa0ft (1.2\xa0m) from the sharks and there is a fine and possible prison sentence for anyone who touches the animals.\n\nWhale sharks are also known as jinbei-zame in Japan (because the markings resemble patterns typically seen on jinbei); gurano bintang (roughly "star from the East") in Indonesia; and ca ong (literally "sir fish") in Vietnam.\n\nThe whale shark is also featured on the latest 2015–2017 edition of the Maldivian 1000 rufiyaa banknote, along with the green turtle.'], 'score': 4.728138}, {'id': 'Pliosauroidea', 'name': ['Pliosauroidea'], 'introduction': ['\n\nsee text\n\nPliosauroidea is an extinct clade of plesiosaurs, known from the earliest Jurassic to early Late Cretaceous. They are best known for the subclade Thalassophonea, which contained crocodile-like short-necked forms with large heads and massive toothed jaws, commonly known as pliosaurs. More primitive non-thalassophonean pliosauroids resembled plesiosaurs in possessing relatively long necks and smaller heads. They originally included only members of the family Pliosauridae, of the order Plesiosauria, but several other genera and families are now also included, the number and details of which vary according to the classification used.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristics are a short neck and an elongated head, with larger hind flippers compared to the fore flippers, the opposite of the plesiosaurs. They were carnivorous and their long and powerful jaws carried many sharp, conical teeth. Pliosaurs range from 4 to 10 meters or more in length. Their prey may have included fish, sharks, ichthyosaurs, dinosaurs and other plesiosaurs.\n\nThe largest known species are Kronosaurus and Pliosaurus macromerus; other well known genera include Rhomaleosaurus, Peloneustes, and Macroplata. Fossil specimens have been found in Africa, Australia, China, Europe, North America and South America.\n\nMany very early (from the Early Jurassic and possibly Latest Triassic, i.e. Rhaetian) primitive pliosauroids were very like plesiosauroids in appearance and, indeed, used to be included in the family Plesiosauridae.'], 'sections': ['Pliosauroidea was named by Welles in 1943. It is adapted from the name of the genus Pliosaurus, which is derived from the Greek πλειων (pleion), meaning "more/closely", and σαυρος (sauros) meaning "lizard"; it therefore means "more saurian". The name Pliosaurus was coined in 1841 by Richard Owen, who believed that it represented a link between plesiosauroids and crocodilians (considered a type of "saurian"), particularly due to their crocodile-like teeth.\n\nThe taxonomy presented here is mainly based on the plesiosaur cladistic analysis proposed by Hilary F. Ketchum and Roger B. J. Benson, 2011 unless otherwise noted.\n\nPliosauroidea is a stem-based taxon that was defined by Welles as "all taxa more closely related to Pliosaurus brachydeirus than to Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus". Pliosauridae and Rhomaleosauridae are stem-based taxa too. Pliosauridae is defined as "all taxa more closely related to Pliosaurus brachydeirus than to Leptocleidus superstes, Polycotylus latipinnis or Meyerasaurus victor". Rhomaleosauridae is defined as "all taxa more closely related to Meyerasaurus victor than to Leptocleidus superstes, Pliosaurus brachydeirus or Polycotylus latipinnis".

This pliosauroid came to be known as the "Monster of Aramberri". Although widely reported as such, it does not belong to the genus Liopleurodon. The remains of this animal, consisting of a partial vertebral column, were dated to the Kimmeridgian of the La Caja Formation. The fossils were found much earlier, in 1985, by a geology student and were at first erroneously attributed to a theropod dinosaur by Hahnel. The remains originally contained part of a rostrum with teeth (now lost).\n\nIn August 2006, palaeontologists of the University of Oslo discovered the first remains of a pliosaur on Norwegian soil. The remains were described as "very well preserved, as well as being unique in their completeness". The large animal was determined to be a new species of Pliosaurus. In the summer of 2008, the fossil remains of the huge pliosaur were dug up from the permafrost on Svalbard, a Norwegian island close to the North Pole. The excavation of the find is documented in the 2009 History television special Predator X.\n\nOn 26 October 2009, palaeontologists reported the discovery of potentially the largest pliosauroid yet found. Found in cliffs near Weymouth, Dorset, on Britain\'s Jurassic Coast, the fossil had a skull length of 6\xa0feet 5\xa0inches (1.96 meters). Palaeontologist Richard Forrest told the BBC: "I had heard rumours that something big was turning up. But seeing this thing in the flesh, so to speak, is just jaw dropping. It is simply enormous." It was determined that the specimen belonged to a new species that scientists named Pliosaurus kevani.\n\nIn December 2023, the recent discovery of a pliosaur skull on the Dorset coast was described as "one of the most complete specimens of its type ever discovered". The discovery and research of the skull was covered in the PBS documentary Attenborough and the Jurassic Sea Monster hosted by David Attenborough.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 4.7256947}, {'id': 'Belgica_antarctica', 'name': ['Belgica antarctica'], 'introduction': ['\n\nBelgica antarctica, the Antarctic midge, is a species of flightless midge, endemic to the continent of Antarctica. At 2–6\xa0mm (0.08–0.2\xa0in) long, it is the largest purely terrestrial animal native to the continent. It also has the smallest known insect genome as of 2014, with only 99 million base pairs of nucleotides and about 13500 genes. It is the only insect that can survive year-round in Antarctica.'], 'sections': ['The first specimens of Belgica antarctica were collected on the Belgian Antarctic Expedition (1897–1899). During this expedition organized by the Belgian Government, Romanian biologist Emil Racoviță collected, among other specimens, a flightless midge and its larvae.  Based on these specimens, the Belgian doctor and entomologist, Jean-Charles Jacobs, described Belgica antarctica Jacobs, 1900. Jacobs named the new genus and species of insect after the location where it was collected off the Antarctic Peninsula, "canal de la Belgica antarctica" (Belgian Strait) (now called Gerlache Strait), which in turn was named after the expedition\'s steam-yacht, SY Belgica.\n\nBelgica antarctica is the largest purely terrestrial animal native to the continent.\n\nThe flightlessness of B. antarctica may be an adaptation to prevent wind from blowing it into inhospitable areas. It can survive freezing, but though local air temperatures may reach as low as −40\xa0°C, this insect cannot survive temperatures below −15\xa0°C. This is comparatively milder than other cold-adapted insects. The reason for this relatively low freezing tolerance is due to thermal buffering: just burrowing at a depth of 1\xa0cm, temperature is stable between 0 and −2\xa0°C for 10 months out of 12, and it seldom goes lower than −7\xa0°C all year round. Ice and snow cover also helps keep the temperature stable. Freezing tolerance is enhanced by cold hardening.\n\nTo adapt to the cold temperatures, B. antarctica accumulates trehalose, glucose, and erythritol. These compounds help the insect survive freezing by reducing the amount of ice that forms within the body. They also stabilize proteins and membranes, binding to them by means of hydrogen bonds. Heat shock proteins also help the tolerance to both high and low temperatures.\n\nBelgica antarctica not only tolerates, but also requires a freezing climate to survive: exposure of larvae to such mild temperatures as 10\xa0°C is enough to kill them within a week. Exposure to temperatures of 30\xa0°C kills individuals in a few hours. It can, however, resist partial desiccation, surviving the loss of up to 70% of body water.\n\nB. antarctica spends most of its two-year lifecycle in four larval stages. Overwintering may occur in any instar. Terrestrial algae (particularly Prasiola crispa), fungi, decaying vegetation, organic detritus, and microorganisms provide the food for the larval stage. The adults, which are aphagous (non-feeding), emerge in the spring and summer and live no more than 10 days; females mate in their first day of life and a few days later release their only batch of eggs (semelparity), as the process damages their abdomens. Males on the other hand, are able to mate more than once. The female secretes a jelly on the eggs that acts as a blanket of antifreeze, stops them from dehydrating, and acts as a food source once they hatch.\nMating occurs in large groups of males, analogous to swarms of winged midges.\n\nAs of 2014, B. antarctica has the smallest insect genome known, at 99 Mbp and 13\xa0500 genes. Although the total amount of coding DNA is similar to that of other Diptera (19 Mbp), its fraction is much higher due to the extreme reduction in some types of non-coding DNA.

The worms are highly adapted to the hard tube they secrete.  Inside the tube the animal is segmented and regionally specialized, with highly modified appendages on different segments for cutting the tunnel, feeding, or creating suction for the flow of water through the tube home. The modified segments for feeding are on the 12th segment from the head for members of this family.'], 'sections': ['Chaetopteridae larvae are the largest among the polychaete worms.  The larvae will range in size from 0.4\xa0mm to 2.5\xa0mm (largest polychaete larvae reported having a maximum length of 12\xa0mm; the late stage of an unknown phyllodocid species).  Chaetopteridae larvae are barrel-like in form with one to two ciliated bands at the midsection.  They also have a large buccal funnel.  These larvae are often long lived and effectively disseminate, although are constrained geographically to their appropriate ranges for successful adult growth.  The most common form of larval developmental plan for polychaetes is the trochophore larvae.  The trochophore will add segments sequentially from a posterior growth zone to produce a nectochaete larva. Chaetopterus represents a distinct deviation from this general design.  At no point in larval growth stages does the metatrochophore take on the clearly segmented form of the typical nectochaete larva.  The 15 segments of Chaetopterus are formed by subdivision of existing anlage.\n\nThe Chaetopteridae have several genera with peculiar and well-studied filter-feeding mechanisms.  The genera Chaetopterus, Mesochaetopterus, and Spiochaetopterus feed using a thin mucus net suspended across the upper portion of their tube.  The mucus net is secreted by a hooplike structure called the aliform notopodia arch.  The net can grow at a rate as great as one millimeter per second as water currents generated by the notopodial fans pass plankton through the net.  When the net grows large enough it contacts the ciliated cup, which rolls up the net.  When the roll becomes large the net is disconnected from the aliform notopodia and is rolled into a ball before the ciliated mid-dorsal groove transports it to the mouth.\n\nMolecular analysis suggests that this group is basal within the annelids, below the sipunculid worms.\n\nThe World Register of Marine Species lists the following genera as being in the family:'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 4.708147}, {'id': 'Thylacoleo', 'name': ['Thylacoleo'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThylacoleo ("pouch lion") is an extinct genus of carnivorous marsupials that lived in Australia from the late Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene (until around 40,000 years ago), often known as marsupial lions.

The generic holotype, consisting of broken teeth, jaws, and a skull was discovered by a pastoralist, William Avery, near Lake Colungolac from which the species Thylacoleo carnifex was described by Richard Owen. It was not until 1966 that the first nearly-complete skeleton was found. The only pieces missing were a foot and the tail. Currently, the Nullarbor Plain of West Australia remains to be the greatest finding site. These fossils now reside at the Australian Museum.\n\nThe genus was first published in 1859, erected to describe the type species Thylacoleo carnifex. The new taxon was established in examination of fossil specimens provided to Richard Owen. The familial alliance takes its name from this description, the so-called marsupial lions of Thylacoleonidae.\n\nThe colloquial name "marsupial lion" alludes to the genus name, which was named after its superficial resemblance to the placental lion and its ecological niche as a large predator.\n\nGenus: Thylacoleo (Thylacopardus) – Australia\'s marsupial lions, that lived from about 2\xa0million years ago, during the Late Pliocene Epoch and became extinct about 40,000 years ago, during the Late Pleistocene Epoch.

The holotype is a third premolar, discovered at a cave in Curramulka in South Australia, exhibiting the carnivorous characteristics of the genus and around half the size of T. carnifex. This tooth was collected by Alan Hill, a speleologist and founding member of the Cave Exploration Group of South Australia, while examining a site known as the "Town Cave" in 1956; the specific epithet hilli honours the collector of the first specimen. Material found amidst the fauna at Bow River in New South Wales, dated to the early Pliocene, was also referred to the species in 1982.\nA fragment of an incisor, unworn and only diagnosable to the genus, was located at a site in Curramulka, close to the Town Cave site, and referred to the species for the apparent correlation in size when compared to the better known T.\xa0carnifex.\n\nThe marsupial lion is classified in the order Diprotodontia along with many other well-known marsupials such as kangaroos, possums, and the koala. It is further classified in its own family, the Thylacoleonidae, of which three genera and 11 species are recognised, all extinct. The term marsupial lion (lower case) is often applied to other members of this family. Distinct possum-like characteristics led Thylacoleo to be regarded as members of Phalangeroidea for a few decades. Though a few authors continued to hint at phalangeroid affinities for thylacoleonids as recently as the 1990s, cranial and other characters have generally led to their inclusion within vombatiformes, and as stem-members of the wombat lineage. Marsupial lions and other ecologically and morphologically diverse vombatiforms were once represented by over 60 species of carnivorous, herbivorous, terrestrial and arboreal forms ranging in size from 3\xa0kg to 2.5 tonnes. Only two families represented by four herbivorous species (koalas and three species of wombat) have survived into modern times and are considered the marsupial lion\'s closest living relatives.\n\nThe ancestors of thylacoleonids are believed to have been herbivores, something unusual for carnivores. They are members of the Vombatiformes, an almost entirely herbivorous order of marsupials, the only extant representatives of which are koalas and wombats, as well as extinct members such as the diprotodontids and palorchestids. The group first appeared in the Late Oligocene. The earliest thylacoleonids like Microleo were small possum-like animals, with the group increasing in size during the Miocene, with representatives like the leopard-sized Wakaleo. The genus Thylacoleo first appeared during the Pliocene, and represented the only extant genus of the family from that time until the end of the Pleistocene. The youngest representative of Thylacoleo and the thylacoleonids, T.\xa0carnifex, is the largest known member of the family. The earliest thylacoleonids are thought to have been arboreal (tree dwelling) animals, while Thylacoleo is thought to be terrestrial with some climbing capabilities.\n\nT. carnifex is the largest carnivorous mammal known to have ever existed in Australia, and one of the largest metatherian carnivores known (comparable to Thylacosmilus and Borhyaena species, but smaller than Proborhyaena gigantea). Individuals ranged up to around 75\xa0cm (30\xa0in) high at the shoulder and about 150\xa0cm (59\xa0in) from head to tail. Measurements taken from a number of specimens show they averaged 101 to 130\xa0kg (223 to 287\xa0lb) in weight, although individuals as large as 124–160\xa0kg (273–353\xa0lb) might not have been uncommon, and the largest weight was of 128–164\xa0kg (282–362\xa0lb). This would make it comparable to female lions and female tigers in general size. Estimates of the size of T. carnifex based on dental remains are typically dubious, in contrast to estimates based on proximal limb bone circumference.\n\nLike other thylacoleonids, Thylacoleo had blade-like third premolar teeth in the upper and lower jaws, that functioned as the carnassial teeth, with these teeth being present much further forwards in the jaw than in other mammals. Compared to earlier thyacoleonids, the third premolars were considerably enlarged. Thylacoleo also had a proportionally large pair of first incisors in the upper and lower jaws, which functioned analogously to other carnivores canine teeth. They also had true canines but they served little purpose as they were stubby and not very sharp. Compared to earlier thylacoleonids, the number of molar teeth was reduced.\n\nPound for pound, T. carnifex had the strongest bite of any mammal species, living or extinct; a T.\xa0carnifex weighing 101\xa0kg (223\xa0lb) had a bite comparable to that of a 250\xa0kg African lion, and research suggests that Thylacoleo could hunt and take prey much larger than itself. Larger animals that were likely prey include Diprotodon spp. and giant kangaroos. It seems improbable that Thylacoleo could achieve as high a bite force as a modern-day lion; however, this might have been possible when taking into consideration the size of its brain and skull. Carnivores usually have rather large brains when compared to herbivorous marsupials, which lessens the amount of bone that can be devoted to enhancing bite force. Thylacoleo however, is thought to have had substantially stronger muscle attachments and therefore a smaller brain. Some later studies questioned the ability of the canine teeth to deliver a killing bite.\n\nUsing 3D modeling based on X-ray computed tomography scans,  marsupial lions were found to be unable to use the prolonged, suffocating bite typical of living big cats. They instead had an extremely efficient and unique bite; the incisors would have been used to stab at and pierce the flesh of their prey while the more specialised carnassials crushed the windpipe, severed the spinal cord, and lacerated the major blood vessels such as the carotid artery and jugular vein. Compared to an African lion which may take 15 minutes to kill a large catch, the marsupial lion could kill a large animal in less than a minute.[dubious – discuss]The skull was so specialized for big game that it was very inefficient at catching smaller animals, which possibly contributed to its extinction.\n\nThylacoleo had highly mobile and powerful forelimbs used to grapple prey, with each manus having a single very large retractable hooked claw set on large semi-opposable thumbs, which are suggested to have been used deal a killing blow.\n\nThe hind feet had four functional toes, the first digit being much reduced in size, but possessing a roughened pad similar to that of possums, which may have assisted with climbing. The discovery in 2005 of a specimen which included complete hind feet provided evidence that the marsupial lion exhibited syndactyly (fused second and third toes) like other diprotodonts.\n\nIts strong forelimbs and retracting claws mean that Thylacoleo possibly climbed trees and perhaps carried carcasses to keep the kill for itself (similar to the leopard today). The climbing ability would have also helped them climb out of caves, which could therefore have been used as dens to rear their young. Specialised tail bones called chevrons strengthened the tail, likely allowing the animal to use it to prop itself up while rearing on its hind legs, which may have been done when climbing or attacking prey.\n\nThe lumbar region is relatively rigid and straight, and suggests that the lower back was relatively inflexible.\n\nWhen Thylacoleo was first described by Richard Owen, he considered it to be a carnivore, based on the morphology of its skull and teeth. However other anatomists, such as William Henry Flower disagreed. Flower was the first to place Thylacoleo with the Diprotodonts, noting its skull and teeth to be laid out more like those of the koala and the wombat, and suggested that it was more likely a herbivore. Owen did not disagree with Flower\'s placement of Thylacoleo with the Diprotodonts, but still maintained that it was a carnivore, despite its herbivorous ancestry. Owen found little support in his lifetime, despite the pointing out of Thylacoleo\'s retractable claws, something only found in mammalian carnivores, and its lack of any ability to chew plant material.  In 1911, a study by Spencer and Walcott claimed that certain marks on the bones of megafauna had been made by Thylacoleo, but according to Horton (1979) they were not sufficiently rigorous, resulting in their arguments being strongly challenged by later scholars, such as Anderson (1929), and later Gill (1951, 1952, 1954), thereby leaving the issue unresolved.\n\nBesides the most common hypothesis that it was an active predator, a variety of other theories existed in the late 19th to early 20th centuries as to the diet and feeding of Thylacoleo, with hypotheses of it being a scavenger filling the ecological niche of hyenas, being a specialist of crocodile eggs, or even a melon-eater. As late as 1954, doubts were still being raised as to whether it was actually a hypercarnivore.\n\nIn 1981, another paper was published arguing that certain cuts to bones of large marsupials had been caused by Thylacoleo. This paper by Horton and Wright was able to counter earlier arguments that such marks were the result of humans, largely by pointing out the presence of similar marks on the opposite side of many bones. They concluded that humans were extremely unlikely to have made the marks in question, but that if so "they had set out to produce only marks consistent with what Thylacoleo would produce". Since then, the academic consensus has emerged that Thylacoleo was a predator and a hypercarnivore.\n\nThe marsupial lion\'s limb proportions and muscle mass distribution indicate that, although it was a powerful animal, it was not a particularly fast runner. Paleontologists conjecture that it was an ambush predator, possibly using leaping. Incisions on bones of the extinct large kangaroo Macropus titan, and the general morphology of Thylacoleo suggests that it fed in a similar manner to modern cheetahs, by using their sharp teeth to slice open the ribcage of their prey, thereby accessing the internal organs. They may have killed by using their front claws as either stabbing weapons or as a way to grab their prey with strangulation or suffocation.\n\nLike many predators, it was probably also an opportunistic scavenger, feeding on carrion and driving off less powerful predators from their kills. It also may have shared behaviours exhibited by recent diprotodont marsupials such as kangaroos, like digging shallow holes under trees to reduce body temperature during the day.\n\nTrace fossils in the form of claw marks and bones from caves in Western Australia analyzed by Gavin Prideaux et al. indicate marsupial lions could also climb rock faces, and likely reared their young in such caves as a way of protecting them from potential predators.\n\nAnalysis of finds on the Nullabor Palin suggests that Thylacoleo carnifex inhabited open, arid environments similar to those found across much of Australia today.\n\nA 1985 study suggested that Thylacoleo carnifex was an apex predator that primarily fed on large bodied prey, which may have included the large kangaroos Sthenurus, Procoptodon, Protemnodon, Macropus and Ostphranter as well as possibly the largest Australian marsupial, the rhinoceros-sized vombatoid Diprotodon.\n\nThylacoleo is thought to have become extinct around 40,000 years ago as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions, essentially simultanteously with the vast majority of Australian megafauna. It has been contested as to the relative importance of climatic change vs the impact of recently arrived Indigenous Australians (who arrived in Australia around 50-60,000 years ago) in the extinctions. There is limited evidence of human interaction with extinct megafauna in Australia.'], 'score': 4.7022886}, {'id': 'Rangifer_tarandus_tarandus', 'name': ['Rangifer tarandus tarandus'], 'introduction': ['\n\nThe mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), also called the Norwegian reindeer, northern reindeer, common reindeer or mountain caribou, is a mid-sized to large subspecies of the reindeer that is native to the western Scandinavian Peninsula, particularly Norway. In Norway, it is called fjellrein, villrein or tundra-rein.'], 'sections': ['Mountain reindeer are medium to large even-toed ungulates with a thick double coat that protects them from the Norwegian winter. Male reindeer (bulls) weigh on average 70 to 150\xa0kg (154 to 331\xa0pounds), while females (cows) weigh on average 40 to 100\xa0kg (88 to 220\xa0pounds). Both bulls and cows have antlers, but cows do not use them to battle one another; instead, like some bovids, they use their antlers to defend food or territory from intruders. Their summer coat is mostly pale brown with white rumps and, in some genetic variations, black legs and creamy-white necks. Their winter coat can be cream-white with beige shoulders and backs, or completely cream-white.\n\nThe mountain reindeer has several physiological adaptations to cope with different environmental temperatures. Reindeer have hemoglobin that allows for high oxygen unloading even at very cold temperatures. This is essential because reindeer limbs are often kept much colder than core body temperature, a phenomenon known as regional heterothermy. In warmer temperatures, reindeer can also switch from nasal breathing to open mouth panting for evaporative cooling.\n\nThe northern and southern populations were once considered the same subspecies. However, genetic analysis shows that the reindeer found in Dovrefjell, in central Norway, are related to reindeer in Beringia, whereas the reindeer found in southern Norway, such as on the Hardangervidda plateau, are related to reindeer from southern Europe. They may have descended from the Finnish forest reindeer (R. fennicus fennicus) that historically occupied parts of Eastern Europe.\n\nCurrently, wild mountain reindeer can only be found in western Scandinavia, with the biggest populations residing in central and southern Norway. The total population in Norway is between 70,000 and 80,000, with the largest numbers found in Sør-Trøndelag, Nord-Trøndelag and northern Hedmark. A smaller population, 6,000 to 7,000, is found in Hardangervidda.\n\nThe wild populations are indirectly controlled by the Norwegian government. Mountain reindeer in Norway were totally protected from 1902 to 1906. However, a few years after that, the population sank again. In the 3411s, it was estimated to be just 2,700. In the 1930s, quotas were introduced to limit the hunting of reindeer. These regulations, along with migrating reindeer, helped increase the population. By the mid-1990s, the wild reindeer population had rebounded to more than 30,000. Today, mountain reindeer are commonly hunted for food or as trophies.\n\nThe domestic reindeer currently has a population in Norway of about 1.2 million. It has historically played a huge role as a game-hunting animal, a source of food and an alternative choice to pull ploughs when horses were unavailable. Domestic reindeer — which are technically only semi-domesticated, as they will still run wild if given the chance — are one of the most common sources of meat in Norway, particularly in the north, where the Sami people reside, and where domestic cattle are rarer because they cannot survive the cold winters as well as reindeer can. In the south, reindeer meat is eaten often as a traditional Sunday meal or during seasonal events.\n\nBecause the mountain reindeer is so large, it has very few natural predators aside from human hunters. However, lynx and wolverines sometimes prey on young, old or sick reindeer. The brown bear has the strength to tackle an adult female, but it would rather scavenge from the carrion left by lynx or wolverines, or steal their kill, instead of hunting for itself. Wolves are also powerful enough to tackle adult reindeer, but because of the strict control of wolves in Norway, a pack would almost certainly be spotted and killed before it could do so.\n\nThe lynx is the biggest natural threat to mountain reindeer because its small size makes it a perfect ambush predator. Lynx are too small to tackle a healthy adult bull or cow, so they generally target calves. Wolverines follow a similar hunting strategy, although, unlike lynx, they are capable of tackling adult reindeer.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 4.6823907}, {'id': 'Gyps_himalayensis', 'name': ['Gyps himalayensis'], 'introduction': ["\n\nThe Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) or Himalayan griffon vulture is an Old World vulture native to the Himalayas and foothills in North and Northeastern India, as well as the adjacent Tibetan Plateau.

The whitish down on the head of immatures changes to yellowish in adults who have a long and pale brown ruff with white streaks and long and spiky ruff feathers.\n\nThe pale blue facial skin is lighter than the dark blue in Gyps fulvus with this species having a yellowish bill. In flight the long fingers are splayed and there is a pale patagial stripe on the underwing. The wing and tail feathers are dark and contrast with the pale coverts and body, one of the best methods to distinguish this species from the slightly smaller griffon vulture. The feathers on the body have pale shaft streaks.\n\nIt is the largest of the Gyps species, averaging larger in every method of measurement than its relatives, and is perhaps the largest and heaviest bird in the Himalayas.\nWeight in Himalayan vultures ranges from 6\xa0kg (13\xa0lb) to 12.5\xa0kg (28\xa0lb). It has been estimated to weigh an average of 9\xa0kg (20\xa0lb), but weights vary with conditions from 8–12\xa0kg (18–26\xa0lb). Published measurements of the wingspan vary from 2.56 to 3.1\xa0m (8\xa0ft 5\xa0in to 10\xa0ft 2\xa0in), a similar range to that of cinereous vulture, but the wingspan varies greatly depending on the method used to measure them.\n\nIt differs from the similar-coloured Indian vulture (G. indicus) by a stouter, more robust bill; younger birds have a pale bill and tend to have buffy-white streaks on the scapulars and wing coverts contrasting with dark brown underparts. It is similar in size to the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), which typically has a slightly shorter overall length but can weigh more than the Himalayan vulture.\n\nThe Himalayan vulture lives mainly in the higher regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau at the elevation range of 1,200–5,500\xa0m (3,900–18,000\xa0ft). It is distributed from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Iran to Pakistan to India, Nepal, Bhutan to western China and Mongolia. Juvenile birds may however disperse further south, and vagrants have been recorded in Thailand, Burma, Singapore and Cambodia.\n\nThe Himalayan vulture perches on crags, favourite sites showing white marks from regular defecation. They tend to not range below an elevation of 1,215\xa0m (3,986\xa0ft). Himalayan vultures often bask in the sun on rocks. They soar in thermals and are not capable of sustained flapping flight. Flocks may follow grazers up the mountains in their search for dead animals. This vulture makes a rattling sound when descending on a carcass and can grunt or hiss at roosts or when feeding on carrion. While feeding, individuals may make cackling sounds to defend their food from other vultures or even reprimand them. They are social birds, and are hence found in large flocks, while even being accompanied by crows (observed with other vulture species as well). Such crows cannot interfere with the flocks (as vultures are physically larger and stronger than crows), but vehicular traffic, human interference, and attacks from herding dogs can pose a disturbance.\n\nThey have been recorded eating carrion exclusively, some which is fed on even when putrid. On the Tibetan Plateau, it was noted that 64% of their diet was obtained from deceased domestic yak (Bos grunniens). The birds fed on old carcasses, sometimes even waiting for several days near a dead animal. However, each vulture species has a specialty diet: Himalayan vultures largely disdain offal (which is readily eaten by other vulture species), typically eating only fleshy tissue. Historically, Himalayan vultures regularly fed on human corpses left out on Celestial burial grounds.\n\nThe Himalayan vulture is fairly defensive around other scavengers, such as foxes or smaller felines, and typically dominates other meat-eaters at carcasses, though it is subservient to gray wolves (Canis lupus), snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus). In a large party, these vultures can reportedly strip a carcass of all tissue in 30 minutes, and do the same to a yak carcass in roughly 120 minutes. Himalayan vultures have been observed feeding on pine (Pinus roxburghii) needles, an unexplained behaviour that cannot be for obtaining nutrition, but may be done to access essential oils and terpenes in the needles for digestive or immunity benefits.\n\nThe breeding season begins in January. The nest is a platform of sticks placed on an inaccessible ledge on a cliff. Nest in northeastern India have been recorded at between 1,215 and 1,820\xa0m (3,986 and 5,971\xa0ft) in elevation, but those in Tibet have been as high as 4,245\xa0m (13,927\xa0ft). Several pairs may nest on the same cliff face, with between five and seven pairs being a typical colony size. The nests are relatively small for the large size of these birds and, although grow larger with repeated uses, do not generally get as massive as the nest of other large accipitrids. There is at least one recorded instance of Himalayan vultures using a nest made by bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus). On the Tibetan Plateau, Himalayan and bearded vultures were observed nesting in close proximity without conflict, which is notable because in several other cases of adjacent interspecies nesting by Old World vultures (including some involving bearded vultures) have resulted in high aggression and interspecies attacks. A single white egg marked with red splotches is the usual clutch. Egg laying dates in northern India have ranged from December 25 to March 7. The egg is coarse and oval and can measure from 87 to 103.6\xa0mm (3.43 to 4.08\xa0in) in height and 65 to 74\xa0mm (2.6 to 2.9\xa0in) in width, with an average of 94.8 by 70.1\xa0mm (3.73 by 2.76\xa0in). In captivity the incubation period was about 54–58 days. The young birds stay on with the parents for six to seven months.\n\nHimalayan vultures are susceptible to toxicity induced by diclofenac, a drug whose residues in domestic animal carcasses has led to rapid declines in populations of other Gyps vultures across Asia. The Himalayan griffon vulture populations have however not shown signs of rapid decline, although reductions in nesting birds have been noted in some parts of its range in Nepal.'], 'score': 4.6549077}, {'id': 'Hesperonychus', 'name': ['Hesperonychus'], 'introduction': ['\n\nHesperonychus (meaning "western claw") is a genus of small paravian theropod dinosaur.

The fossil remained undescribed, however, until Nick Longrich and Phil Currie published on it in 2009. A number of very small toe bones discovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation, including "sickle claws", in the collection of the Royal Tyrrell Museum have been tentatively referred to as cf. Hesperonychus.\n\nThe gracile appearances of these potential toe bones make it unlikely that Hesperonychus belonged to the Eudromaeosauria. Despite their small size, the pubic bones were fused, a characteristic of adult dinosaurs, indicating that the specimen does not represent a juvenile of a known species. Though known from partial remains, researchers have estimated that it was a small dinosaur measuring about 1 metre (3.3\xa0ft) long and weighing between 1.5 and 2 kilograms (3.3 and 4.4\xa0lb), making it one of the smallest non-avian dinosaurs known from North America.\n\nA phylogenetic analysis performed by Longrich and Currie found Hesperonychus to be a member of the Microraptorinae, a clade of small dromaeosaurids previously thought to be restricted to the Early Cretaceous of Asia. The authors described this find as "remarkable"; the previously youngest known microraptorine was Microraptor itself from the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous, so the discovery of Hesperonychus in the Late Cretaceous Campanian stage pushed the fossil range of microraptorines forward by 45 million years. While the Late Cretaceous, North American Bambiraptor had sometimes been classified as a microraptorine, other researchers (including Longrich and Currie) have found that it is more closely related to Saurornitholestes.\n\nHesperonychus was assigned to Microraptoria due to having a spatulate (rounded) pubic symphysis, a strong posterior curvature of the distal shaft of the pubis, and lateral tubercules on the pubes, which are expanded into \'wing-like\' structures in the case of Hesperonychus.\n\nCladogram (2012):\n\nXiaotingia\n\nUnenlagiinae\n\nShanag\n\nSaurornitholestinae\n\nVelociraptorinae\n\nDromaeosaurinae\n\nTianyuraptor\n\nHesperonychus\n\nMicroraptor sp.\n\nMicroraptor gui\n\nMicroraptor zhaoianus\n\nCryptovolans\n\nGraciliraptor\n\nSinornithosaurus\n\nHowever, subsequent studies have questioned its identity as a microraptorine, with some researchers excluding the taxon from phylogenetic analyses due to its fragmentary remains and others classifying it in various positions within or outside dromaeosaurids. In 2012, Martyniuk considered Hesperonychus as a eudromaeosaurian. In 2013, microraptorines were considered as averaptorans outside dromaeosaurids. In 2014, Brusatte and colleagues pruned five "wildcard" taxa including the paravians Pyroraptor and Hesperonychus from phylogenetic analyses, mainly due to a huge lack of data, indicating that the definitive classifications of these taxa are uncertain. Other studies have also followed this exclusion of Hesperonychus.\n\nIn 2019, Hartman and colleagues suggested that Hesperonychus is actually an avialan close to modern birds like Balaur bondoc based on phylogenetic analyses, though they disagreed with microraptorines being avialans. In the same year, Rauhut and colleagues considered various genera of theropods including Hesperonychus as \'problematic taxa\' due to their unstable phylogenetic position. In 2020, Hesperonychus was recovered as a dromaeosaurid and a sister taxon, but not a member, of the polytomic microraptorines.\n\nMicroraptorines are well known for their small size and, in some cases, ability to fly or glide. Longrich and Currie concluded that it was unlikely for Hesperonychus to exhibit four wings or gliding behavior as in Microraptor, and speculated that it was more likely to be similar to Sinornithosaurus given their closer similarity in size. Nevertheless, Hesperonychus seems to show that microraptorines did not vary much in size, remaining very small relative to other dromaeosaurids throughout their history, though it is questionable whether it was indeed a microraptorine or a dromaeosaurid.\n\nWhether it was a microraptorine or not, the discovery of Hesperonychus filled in a gap in the ecology of Late Cretaceous North America. Unlike roughly contemporary environments in Europe and Asia, North America appeared to lack very small carnivorous dinosaurs. In modern ecosystems dominated by endothermic mammals, small animal species outnumber larger ones. Since dinosaurs are also presumed to have been endotherms, the lack of small species and great number of known large species in North America was unusual. Hesperonychus helped to fill that gap, especially since, given the number of fragmentary remains and claws that have been collected (representing at least ten distinct specimens, compared to thirty of the contemporary Saurornitholestes and two of Dromaeosaurus), it appears to have been a very common feature of the Dinosaur Park Formation environment.\n\nThe next smallest carnivore in the environment was the mammal Eodelphis, which weighed only 600\xa0grams. There does not appear to have been any overlap between the smallest dinosaurs and the largest mammals in ecosystems such as this, which Longrich and Currie explained by hypothesizing that either competition from dinosaurs kept mammals from growing larger (the traditional view), competition from mammals kept the dinosaurs from growing smaller, or both.'], 'score': 4.651573}, {'id': 'Simalia_kinghorni', 'name': ['Simalia kinghorni'], 'introduction': ["\n\nThe Australian scrub python (Simalia kinghorni), also known commonly as Kinghorn's python and simply as the scrub python is a species of snake in the family Pythonidae.

The specific name, kinghorni, is in honour of Australian herpetologist and ornithologist James Roy Kinghorn. It was first raised to species status by Wells and Wellington in 1984, and given the name Australiasis kinghorni. American biologist Michael Harvey and colleagues investigated the amethystine python complex and confirmed its classification as a separate species based on cladistic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences and morphology. In 2014 cladistic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial genes of pythons and boas, R. Graham Reynolds and colleagues concluded that the support for its distinctness was weak.\n\nThe Australian scrub python is commonly considered arboreal or tree-dwelling,[citation needed] making it one of the world's largest and longest arboreal species of snakes.[citation needed] This snake has an ornate dorsal pattern consisting of browns and tans, with many different natural variations, and an iridescent sheen. Its belly is usually white, sometimes with some yellows.[citation needed] The top of the head is covered with large symmetrical shields, and there are heat-sensing pits on the rostral and some labials.\n\nS. kinghorni exhibits an unusual sexual dimorphism among pythons. Males are usually a third longer and twice as heavy. Females reach sexual maturity with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of about 2.27\xa0m (7.4\xa0ft) while males reach sexual maturity with an SVL of 1.34\xa0m (4.4\xa0ft). On the Tully River, a river about 140 km south of Cairns, 24 adult females were measured. They had an average SVL of 2.68\xa0m (8.8\xa0ft) and a mass of 3.4\xa0kg (7.5\xa0lb). In the same place, 80 adult males had an average SVL of 2.91\xa0m (9.5\xa0ft) and a weight of 5.1\xa0kg (11\xa0lb). Of these, the largest male had an SVL of 3.76\xa0m (12.3\xa0ft) and a weight of 11\xa0kg (24\xa0lb).\nIn the past, data on the lengths of individuals longer than 6 meters were repeatedly mentioned in the literature, and all of them today can no longer be verified and cause serious doubts, in particular, in Fearn & Sambono (2000). The most extreme information comes from Worell, who reported in 1954 second-hand about an animal allegedly 8.5\xa0m (28\xa0ft) long from Greenhill in Cairns, described it as 7.6\xa0m (25\xa0ft) in 1958 and repeatedly mentioned the same thing in 1963 under the first length. He leaves open the question of whether the reported length refers to a corpse or to skin stretched more than 3\xa0m (9.8\xa0ft). Dean also describes an extremely large specimen from Barron Falls in 1954 with a total length of 7.2\xa0m (24\xa0ft), which, however, consisted of an artificially stretched frame that decomposed in the tropics for more than two days, though it was considered reliable by the staff of the Guinness Book of World Records. The largest female Australian scrub python seriously measured to date was caught in Palm Cove near Cairns in 2000, had a total length (including tail) of 5.65\xa0m (18.5\xa0ft), a head length of 12\xa0cm (4.7\xa0in), a tail length of 75\xa0cm (30\xa0in), a circumference at midbody of 36\xa0cm (14\xa0in), and a weight of 24\xa0kg (53\xa0lb). The largest male seriously measured to date was discovered in Kuranda in 2002. Its length was 5.33\xa0m (17.5\xa0ft), of which the length of the head was 11\xa0cm (4.3\xa0in), the incomplete tail was 60\xa0cm (24\xa0in), and the weight was 19\xa0kg (42\xa0lb). However, heavier individuals have been measured, some weighing more than 27\xa0kg (60\xa0lb) with a length of more than 5\xa0m (16\xa0ft).\n\nS. kinghorni in mostly is found in Northern Australia, in Queensland and Cape York Peninsula. The species also occurs in several Islands of Torres Strait (e.g. Hinchinbrook). On the mainland, its range extends from the tip of the Cape York Peninsula south along the coastal rainforest through the Atherton Tableland, the forested eastern foothills of the Great Dividing Range, along the coast through Mount Speck to the Burdekin River south of Townsville. In 2004, an even more southern population was described in the Conway rainforest, south of Airlie Beach. Accurate information about the population size and possible connections with more northern populations is not yet available. However, it is assumed that it was installed in 1990 by adult animals that escaped from the local zoo, and has been successfully distributed since then living within various forests and more densely vegetated parts of the Australian bush.\n\nS. kinghorni is one of the largest land predators in Australia, and depending on the habitat, age and size, the prey range can vary from small mammals, birds and reptiles to wallabies. The basis of the diet consists of birds and mammals. Among them, for example, rainbow bee-eaters (Merops ornatus), bush rats (Rattus fuscipes), northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus), spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus), northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) and striped possums (Dactylopsila trivirgata). In addition, on the outskirts of settlements, the species repeatedly feeds on domestic poultry.

Paiva on his own property in the Panoche Hills of Fresno County, California, which were taken to Berkeley in the spring of 1937 by W. M. Tucker, who was the Chairman of the Department of Geology of Fresno State College. Afterwards, Fresno State College and the University of California Museum of Paleontology organized a joint expedition which would uncover a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of the animal, with only parts of the skull, shoulder girdle, flippers and certain vertebral elements missing. This specimen, designated UCMP 33912, was collected in a ravine on the property of the Sun Ray Gypsum Mine, about 22 miles west of Mendota, California, and the deposits from which it originates are part of the Moreno Formation. In 1943, American paleontologist Samuel Paul Welles found that the specimen was notably different from other known plesiosaurs and declared it as the type specimen of a new genus and species which he named Hydrotherosaurus alexandrae.

It has one of the longest necks relative to total length among elasmosaurids, with 60 vertebrae in total. It had a small head that measured about 33 centimetres (13\xa0in; 1.08\xa0ft) long, a streamlined body, and four large flippers that were specially designed to help the huge animal balance, move, and accelerate itself.[citation needed]'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'score': 4.605242}, {'id': 'Titanoceratops', 'name': ['Titanoceratops'], 'introduction': ['\n\nTitanoceratops (meaning "titanic horned face") is a controversial genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur. It was a giant chasmosaurine ceratopsian that lived in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage, about 75 million years ago) in what is now New Mexico. Titanoceratops was named for its large size, being one of the largest known horned dinosaurs and the type species was named T. ouranos, after Uranus (Ouranos), the father of the Greek titans. It was named in 2011 by Nicholas R. Longrich for a specimen previously referred to Pentaceratops. Longrich believed that unique features found in the skull reveal it to have been a close relative of Triceratops, classified within the subgroup Triceratopsini. However, other researchers have expressed skepticism, and believe "Titanoceratops" to simply be an unusually large, old specimen of Pentaceratops.\n\nThe holotype specimen is OMNH\xa010165, a partial skeleton including a mostly complete skull and jaws, and much of the skeleton. It was found in either the upper Fruitland Formation or the lower Kirtland Formation. The original quarry is lost, so it is not known which formation the fossil was excavated from. The formations are both late Campanian in age. The skull is incomplete, but as currently reconstructed it measures 2.65 metres (8.7\xa0ft) long, making it a candidate for the longest skull of any land animal. With an estimated weight of 6.55 tonnes (6.45 long tons; 7.22 short tons) and length of 6.8 metres (22.3\xa0ft), Titanoceratops was comparable in size with the largest ceratopsians, Torosaurus and Triceratops, and was likely the largest animal in its ecosystem, if not in North America, at the time.'], 'kingdom': ['Animalia'], 'sections': ['The skull measures 1.2\xa0m (3.9\xa0ft) from the tip of the snout to the quadrate, and the restored frill extends its length up to 2.65\xa0m (8.7\xa0ft) making it a candidate for the longest skull of any land animal. Titanoceratops was as large as the later triceratopsins Triceratops and Torosaurus, with an estimated weight of 6.55 tonnes (7.22 short tons) and a mounted skeleton measuring 6.8 metres (22.3\xa0ft) long and 2.5 metres (8.2\xa0ft) tall at the back. In 2016 Gregory S. Paul gave a lower estimation of 6.5 meters (21.3\xa0ft) and 4.5 tonnes (4.9 short tons). Tom Holtz (2012) noted that it is extremely similar to its closely related contemporaries Eotriceratops and Ojoceratops, which may all be synonymous. The holotype skeleton of Titanoceratops consists of a partial skull with jaws, syncervical, cervical, dorsal, and sacral vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, ribs, humeri, a right radius, femora, tibiae, a right fibula, both ilia, both ischia, and ossified tendons. In total, the amount of material assigned to Titanoceratops means it is quite well known, along with genera like Triceratops, Vagaceratops, Pentaceratops, Chasmosaurus, Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Anchiceratops.\n\nThe holotype of Titanoceratops was collected from the upper Fruitland Formation or the lower Kirtland Formation in July 1941, by a field crew consisting J. Willis Stovall, his student Wann Langston Jr., and Donald E. Savage. The precise location of the quarry is no longer known. The holotype specimen consists of most of the fore and hindlimbs, some vertebrae, a fairly complete skull with only one small section of the frill, and partial lower jaws. The bones, being preserved in a fine-grained shale, were crushed and fragile, and so the skeleton was initially considered unsuitable for mounting. Later, however, the fossils were prepared and the skeleton put on display at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History.\n\nIn 1998, the specimen was described by Thomas Lehman as an aberrant and unusually large individual of Pentaceratops sternbergii, previously described from the same area. The specimen was later reinterpreted as a member of the Triceratopsini, the group including Triceratops, by Nicholas R. Longrich and given the name Titanoceratops ouranos in 2011. The name Titanoceratops is derived from the Greek Titan, a mythical race of giants, keras (κέρας), meaning "horn", and ops (ὤψ), "face". The species name ouranos, refers to Uranus, the father of the Titan race. Longrich\'s re-interpretation would have major implications for the evolutionary history and biogeography of chasmosaurine dinosaurs. Previously, the origins of Triceratops were poorly known. Until the Longrich\'s re-interpretation of Titanoceratops, Eotriceratops was thought to be the oldest known triceratopsin, and only dated to 68\xa0million years old, from the uppermost region of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. No Campanian triceratopsins were known, so it appeared as if the group evolved in the Maastrichtian. If Titanoceratops is a member of this group, it would demonstrate that they evolved millions of years earlier than previously thought, and it would imply a five million year long gap in the fossil record and ghost lineage leading to Eotriceratops. However, several subsequent studies have cast doubt on the hypothesis that Titanoceratops is a triceratopsin.\n\nOMNH 10165 is a particularly large chasmosaurine fossil, which Lehman originally assigned to the genus Pentaceratops, believing that it was a particularly large and old specimen. A 2011 study by Longrich disagreed with this interpretation, concluding that it was actually a distinct genus, which he named Titanoceratops. Longrich interpreted the specimen as sharing more characteristics with Triceratops and Torosaurus than with Pentaceratops, and he named a new group, Triceratopsini, to contain all of them. Longrich used the following features to distinguish the specimen from other chasmosaurines: the possession of thin squamosals (Triceratops); an unsealed parietal fenestrae (Triceratops); an epijugal resembling a hornlike structure (Triceratops); a narrow median bar of the parietal (Triceratops, Torosaurus); a narial strut oriented vertically with a narrow base (Triceratops, Torosaurus); an enlarged epoccipital on the rear end of the squamosal (Triceratops, Torosaurus, Eotriceratops); an extremely enlarged premaxillary fossa (Triceratops, Torosaurus, Eotriceratops); and in lacking a narial process of the premaxilla that is dorsally inflected (Triceratops, Torosaurus, Eotriceratops).\n\nLehman ignored Longrich\'s reclassification in his own subsequent publications. As part of a 2020 study by Fowler and Freedman Fowler, the authors critically re-evaluated the evidence that Titanoceratops was a distinct genus. They agreed with Lehman\'s original assessment, that the features in the specimen that appeared unique were likely due simply to advanced age and unusually large size. Pending a full re-evaluation of the specimen by other researchers, Fowler and Freedman Fowler opted to consider OMNH 10165 simply a large Pentaceratops.\n\nTitanoceratops is known from OMNH\xa010165, a skeleton from the lowermost Fruitland or uppermost Kirtland Formation. The Fruitland Formation is about 100 metres (330\xa0ft) thick, and consists of sandstones, mudstones, and abundant coals deposited in a coastal floodplain. Fossil trees are abundant in the area from which the holotype was collected, suggesting a wet, well-forested environment.\n\nThe Kirtland Formation, which conformably overlays the Fruitland, is approximately 600 metres (2,000\xa0ft) thick, and made up of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and shale. Both formations are late Campanian in age. The Fossil Forest Member of the Fruitland is 74.11\xa0±\xa00.62\xa0million years old, and the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland is between 73.37\xa0±\xa00.18 and 73.04\xa0±\xa00.25\xa0million years in age. The two members combined make up the Hunter Wash local fauna. Therefore, Titanoceratops dates between 74 and 73 million years ago. The age Titanoceratops lived in is called the Kirtlandian land-vertebrate age, and it is characterized by the appearance of Pentaceratops sternbergii.\n\nA moderately diverse fauna is known from the Kirtland and Fruitland formations. Among the dinosaurs known from the Fruitland and Kirtland formations are the theropods Bistahieversor sealeyi (previously Daspletosaurus and Albertosaurus sp.), "Saurornitholestes" robustus, Paronychodon lacustris, and an indeterminate ornithomimid (previously Ornithomimus antiquus); the hadrosaurids Anasazisaurus horneri and Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus; the pachycephalosaur Stegoceras novomexicanum (previously S. validum); the ankylosaur Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis; and the ceratopsians Pentaceratops sternbergii and an unidentified centrosaurine.\n\nNon-dinosaurian fauna include the fishes Myledaphus bypartitus, and Melvius chauliodous; the turtles Denazinemys ornata, Denazinemys nodosa, Boremys grandis, Neurankylus baeuri, Adocus bossi, Adocus kirtlandicus, Basilemys nobilis, Asperideretes ovatus, "Plastomenus" robustus, and Bothremydidae n. gen., barberl; the crocodylians Denazinosuchus kirtlandicus, Brachychampsa montana, Deinosuchus rugosus, and Leidyosuchus sp.; and the mammalians Paracimexomys judithae, Mesodma senecta, Mesodma sp., Cimexomys sp., Cinemoxys antiquus, Kimbetohia campi, Cimolodon electus, Meniscoessus intermedius, Essonodon sp., Alphadon marshi, Alphadon wilsoni, Alphadon sp. A, Alphadon sp. B, Alphadon? sp., Pediomys cooki; Gypsonictops sp., Cimolestes sp., and an indeterminate eucosmodontid.\n\nTitanoceratops supports the idea that late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas were highly endemic, with distinct species found in the Southern Great Plains of New Mexico, and the Northern Great Plains of Montana and Canada. Despite extensive sampling to the north in the Dinosaur Park Formation and Two Medicine Formation, triceratopsins are unknown there. This implies that the triceratopsins originally evolved in the south, then spread north in the Maastrichtian.'], 'score': 4.592903}]}}
