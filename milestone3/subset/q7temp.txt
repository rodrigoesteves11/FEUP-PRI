      "introduction":"\n\nMus lemmus Linnaeus, 1758\n\nThe Norway lemming, also known as the Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) is a common species of lemming found in northern Fennoscandia, where it is the only vertebrate species endemic to the region. The Norway lemming dwells in tundra and fells, and prefers to live near water.  Adults feed primarily on sedges, grasses and moss.  They are active at both day and night, alternating naps with periods of activity.",

      "sections":"It has a wide distribution from western Norway east to the Kola Peninsula. A 2021 study suggests that the lemmings of Novaya Zemlya may also belong to this species; this would extend its range east to Novaya Zemlya island, but these results have not been fully accepted.\n\nThe mainland Norway lemming has a bold pattern of black and yellow-brown, which is variable between individuals. In contrast, the Novaya Zemlya lemming has a cryptic gray coloration (hence why it was previously thought to be a population of the Siberian brown lemming). The species grows to a size of 155 mm (6.1 in). The tail is very short 10–19 mm (3⁄8–3⁄4 in). It weighs up to 130 g (4.6 oz). The dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 3/3.\n\nThe Norway lemming has a dramatic three- to four-year population cycle, in which the species' population periodically rises to unsustainable levels, leading to high mortality, which causes the population to crash again.\n\nThe Norway lemming spends the winter in nests under the snow. When the spring thaws begin and the snow starts to collapse, they must migrate to higher ground, where the snow is still firm enough for safety, or, more commonly, to lower ground, where they spend the summer months.[citation needed] In autumn, they must time their movement back to sheltered higher ground carefully, leaving after alpine snow cover is available for their burrows and nests, and before the lowlands are made uninhabitable by frost and ice.\n\nWhen the seasons are particularly good (short winters without unexpected thaws or freezes, and long summers), the Norway lemming population can increase exponentially; they reach sexual maturity less than a month after birth,  and breed year-round if conditions are right, producing a litter of six to eight young every three to four weeks.[citation needed] Being solitary creatures by nature, the stronger lemmings drive the weaker and younger ones off long before a food shortage occurs. The young lemmings disperse in random directions looking for vacant territory. Where geographical features constrain their movements and channel them into a relatively narrow corridor, large numbers can build up, leading to social friction, distress, and eventually a mass panic can follow, where they flee in all directions. Lemmings do migrate, and in vast numbers sometimes, but notion of a deliberate march into the sea is false.\n\nAccording to genetic research, the Norwegian lemming survived the Pleistocene glaciation in western Europe, inhabiting various refugia which were not covered by ice.  Alternatively, some researchers have contended the Norwegian lemming populations had arisen from ancestors of the present-day brown lemming (Lemmus sibiricus), moving in after glaciers receded. The Novaya Zemlya lemming, which could represent either a subspecies of L. lemmus, or a population of L. sibiricus with mtDNA introgression from ancient hybridization with L. lemmus, supports the former theory.\n\nDespite their diminutive size, when confronted at close quarters by a potential predator, mainland Norway lemmings characteristically become highly aggressive. They have also been known to attack approaching humans. It has been suggested that they may be considered an aposematic subspecies, in that they appear to deter predation by using their prominent coloration, loud calls, and aggressive behavior to advertise their ability to harm small predators (in contrast to the less conspicuous voles). On the other hand, when viewed from a distance, their coloration may also facilitate a cryptic defence option by helping them to fade into the background.\n\nIn 2021, a taxonomic study analyzing a distinct population of lemmings on Novaya Zemlya, previously thought to be Siberian brown lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus), found them to be more closely related to L. lemmus, and reclassified them as a new subspecies L. lemmus chernovi, or the Novaya Zemlya lemming, named after zoologist and academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yury I. Chernov. It is currently only known from the southern island of the archipelago. It is thought that prior to the Eemian Interglacial, L. lemmus was distributed widely throughout the Arctic Shelf from Western Europe east to Novaya Zemlya, and sea level rise during the Eemian left the species in its present-day disjunct distribution, with populations only on Fennoscandia and Novaya Zemlya. Novaya Zemlya may have served as a refugium for cold-adapted terrestrial fauna such as L. lemmus during the Pleistocene interglacial periods. The Novaya Zemlya lemming lacks the aposematic coloration of the Norway lemming, being dull in color and lacking antipredator adaptations. It is thought that the aposematic traits may be specific to the mainland population and evolved during its isolation in the Fennoscandian refugium.\n\nAn evaluation of the study later in the year by the American Society of Mammalogists stated that the Novaya Zemlya lemming likely represented a population of L. sibiricus with mtDNA introgression from L. lemmus, and thus concluded that pending further research, it would be best to include the Novaya Zemlya lemming within L. sibiricus.",

      "introduction":"\n\nsee text\n\nNight monkeys, also known as owl monkeys or douroucoulis (/duːruːˈkuːliz/), are nocturnal New World monkeys of the genus Aotus, the only member of the family Aotidae (/eɪˈɒtɪdiː/). The genus comprises eleven species which are found across Panama and much of South America in primary and secondary forests, tropical rainforests and cloud forests up to 2,400 metres (7,900 ft). Night monkeys have large eyes which improve their vision at night, while their ears are mostly hidden, giving them their name Aotus, meaning \"earless\".\n\nNight monkeys are the only truly nocturnal monkeys with the exception of some cathemeral populations of Azara's night monkey, who have irregular bursts of activity during day and night. They have a varied repertoire of vocalisations and live in small family groups of a mated pair and their immature offspring. Night monkeys have monochromatic vision which improves their ability to detect visual cues at night.\n\nNight monkeys are threatened by habitat loss, the pet trade, hunting for bushmeat, and by biomedical research. They constitute one of the few monkey species affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and are therefore used as experimental subjects in malaria research.

      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Until 1983, all night monkeys were placed into only one (A. lemurimus) or two species (A. lemurinus and A. azarae). Chromosome variability showed that there was more than one species in the genus and Hershkovitz (1983) used morphological and karyological evidence to propose nine species, one of which is now recognised as a junior synonym. He split Aotus into two groups: a northern, gray-necked group (A. lemurinus, A. hershkovitzi, A. trivirgatus and A. vociferans) and a southern, red-necked group (A. miconax, A. nancymaae, A. nigriceps and A. azarae). Arguably, the taxa otherwise considered subspecies of A. lemurinus – brumbacki, griseimembra and zonalis – should be considered separate species, whereas A. hershkovitzi arguably is a junior synonym of A. lemurinus. A new species from the gray-necked group was recently described as A. jorgehernandezi. As is the case with some other splits in this genus, an essential part of the argument for recognizing this new species was differences in the chromosomes. Chromosome evidence has also been used as an argument for merging \"species\", as was the case for considering infulatus a subspecies of A. azarae rather than a separate species. One extinct species is known from the fossil record.\n\nFamily Aotidae\n\nNight monkeys have large brown eyes; the size improves their nocturnal vision increasing their ability to be active at night. They are sometimes said to lack a tapetum lucidum, the reflective layer behind the retina possessed by many nocturnal animals. Other sources say they have a tapetum lucidum composed of collagen fibrils. At any rate, night monkeys lack the tapetum lucidum composed of riboflavin crystals possessed by lemurs and other strepsirrhines, which is an indication that their nocturnality is a secondary adaption evolved from ancestrally diurnal primates.\n\nTheir ears are rather difficult to see; this is why their genus name, Aotus (meaning \"earless\") was chosen. There is little data on the weights of wild night monkeys. From the figures that have been collected, it appears that males and females are similar in weight; the heaviest species is Azara's night monkey at around 1,254 grams (2.765 lb), and the lightest is Brumback's night monkey, which weighs between 455 and 875 grams (1.003 and 1.929 lb). The male is slightly taller than the female, measuring 346 and 341 millimetres (13.6 and 13.4 in), respectively.\n\nNight monkeys can be found in Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela. The species that live at higher elevations tend to have thicker fur than the monkeys at sea level. Night monkeys can live in forests undisturbed by humans (primary forest) as well as in forests that are recovering from human logging efforts (secondary forest).\n\nA primary distinction between red-necked and gray-necked night monkeys is spatial distribution. Gray-necked night monkeys (Aotus lemurinus group) are found north of the Amazon River, while the red-necked group (Aotus azare group) are localized south of the Amazon River. Red-necked night monkeys are found throughout various regions of the Amazon rainforest of South America, with some variation occurring between the four species. Nancy Ma's night monkey occurs in both flooded and unflooded tropical rainforest regions of Peru, preferring moist swamp and mountainous areas. This species has been observed nesting in regions of the Andes and has recently been introduced to Colombia, likely as a result of post-research release into the community. The black-headed night monkey is also found mainly in the Peruvian Amazon (central and upper Amazon), however its range extends throughout Brazil and Bolivia to the base of the Andes mountain chain. Night monkeys such like the black-headed night monkey, generally inhabit cloud forests; areas with consistent presence of low clouds with a high mist and moisture content which allows for lush and rich vegetation to grow year round, providing excellent food and lodging sources. The Peruvian night monkey, like Nancy Ma's night monkey, is endemic to the Peruvian Andes however it is found at a higher elevation, approximately 800–2,400 metres (2,600–7,900 ft) above sea level and therefore exploits different niches of this habitat. The distribution of A. azare, extends further towards the Atlantic Ocean, spanning Argentina, Bolivia and the drier, south western regions of Paraguay, however unlike the other red-necked night monkey species, it is not endemic to Brazil.\n\nDuring the daylight hours, night monkeys rest in shaded tree areas. These species have been observed exploiting four different types of tree nests, monkeys will rest in; holes formed in the trunks of trees, in concave sections of branches surrounded by creepers and epiphytes, in dense areas of epiphyte, climber and vine growth and in areas of dense foliage. These sleeping sites provide protection from environmental stressors such as heavy rain, sunlight and heat. Sleeping sites are therefore carefully chosen based upon tree age, density of trees, availability of space for the group, ability of site to provide protection, ease of access to the site and availability of site with respect to daily routines. While night monkeys are an arboreal species, nests have not been observed in higher strata of the rainforest ecosystem, rather a higher density of nests were recorded at low-mid vegetation levels. Night monkeys represent a territorial species, territories are defended by conspecifics through the use of threatening and agonistic behaviours. Ranges between night monkey species often do overlap and result in interspecific aggressions such as vocalizing and chasing which may last up to an hour.\n\nNight monkeys are primarily frugivorous, as fruits are easily distinguished through the use of olfactory cues, but leaf and insect consumption has also been observed in the cathemeral night monkey species A. azare. A study conducted by Wolovich et al., indicated that juveniles and females were much better at catching both crawling and flying insects than adult males. In general, the technique used by night monkeys in insect capturing is to use the palm of the hand to flatten a prey insect against a tree branch and then proceed to consume the carcass. During the winter months or when food sources are reduced, night monkeys have also been observed foraging on flowers such as Tabebuia heptaphylla, however this does not represent a primary food source.\n\nIn night monkeys, mating occurs infrequently, however females are fertile year-round, with reproductive cycles range from 13 to 25 days. The gestation period for night monkey is approximately 117– 159 days but varies from species to species. Birthing season extends from September to March and is species-dependent, with one offspring being produced per year; however, in studies conducted in captivity, twins were observed. Night monkeys reach puberty at a relatively young age, between 7 and 11 months, and most species attain full sexual maturity by the time they reach 2 years of age. A. azare represents an exception reaching sexual maturity by the age of 4.\n\nThe name \"night monkey\" comes from the fact that all species are active at night and are, in fact, the only truly nocturnal monkeys (an exception is the subspecies of Azara's night monkey, Aotus azarae azarae, which is cathemeral). Night monkeys make a notably wide variety of vocal sounds, with up to eight categories of distinct calls (gruff grunts, resonant grunts, sneeze grunts, screams, low trills, moans, gulps, and hoots), and a frequency range of 190–1,950 Hz. Unusual among the New World monkeys, they are monochromats, that is, they have no colour vision, presumably because it is of no advantage given their nocturnal habits. They have a better spatial resolution at low light levels than other primates, which contributes to their ability to capture insects and move at night. Night monkeys live in family groups consisting of a mated pair and their immature offspring. Family groups defend territories by vocal calls and scent marking.\n\nThe night monkey is socially monogamous, and all night monkeys form pair bonds. Only one infant is born each year. The male is the primary caregiver, and the mother carries the infant for only the first week or so of its life. This is believed to have developed because it increases the survival of the infant and reduces the metabolic costs on the female. Adults will occasionally be evicted from the group by same-sex individuals, either kin or outsiders.\n\nThe family Aotidae is the only family of nocturnal species within the suborder Anthropoidea. While the order primates is divided into prosimians; many of which are nocturnal, the anthropoids possess very few nocturnal species and therefore it is highly likely that the ancestors of the family Aotidae did not exhibit nocturnality and were rather diurnal species.  The presence of nocturnal behavior in Aotidae therefore exemplifies a derived trait; an evolutionary adaptation that conferred greater fitness advantages onto the night monkey.  Night monkey share some similarities with nocturnal prosimians including low basal metabolic rate, small body size and good ability to detect visual cues at low light levels. Their responses to olfactory stimulus are intermediate between those of the prosimians and diurnal primate species, however the ability to use auditory cues remains more similar to diurnal primate species than to nocturnal primate species. This provides further evidence to support the hypothesis that nocturnality is a derived trait in the family Aotidae.\n\nAs the ancestor of Aotidae was likely diurnal, selective and environmental pressures must have been exerted on the members of this family which subsequently resulted in the alteration of their circadian rhythm to adapt to fill empty niches. Being active in the night rather than during the day time, gave Aotus access to better food sources, provided protection from predators, reduced interspecific competition and provided an escape from the harsh environmental conditions of their habitat. To begin, resting during the day allows for decreased interaction with diurnal predators. Members of the family Aotidae, apply the predation avoidance theory, choosing very strategic covered nests sites in trees. These primates carefully choose areas with sufficient foliage and vines to provide cover from the sun and camouflage from predators, but which simultaneously allow for visibility of ground predators and permit effective routes of escape should a predator approach too quickly. Activity at night also permits night monkeys to avoid aggressive interactions with other species such as competing for food and territorial disputes; as they are active when most other species are inactive and resting.\n\nNight monkeys also benefit from a nocturnal life style as activity in the night provides a degree of protection from the heat of the day and the thermoregulation difficulties associated. Although night monkey, like all primates are endothermic, meaning they are able to produce their own heat, night monkeys undergo behavioural thermoregulation in order to minimize energy expenditure. During the hottest points of the day, night monkeys are resting and therefore expending less energy in the form of heat. As they carefully construct their nests, night monkeys also benefit from the shade provided by the forest canopy which enables them to cool their bodies through the act of displacing themselves into a shady area. Additionally, finding food is energetically costly and completing this process during the day time usually involves the usage of energy in the form of calories and lipid reserves to cool the body down. Foraging during the night when it is cooler, and when there is less competition, supports the optimal foraging theory; maximize energy input while minimizing energy output.\n\nWhile protection from predators, interspecific interactions, and the harsh environment propose ultimate causes for nocturnal behavior as they increase the species fitness, the proximate causes of nocturnality are linked to the environmental effects on circadian rhythm. While diurnal species are stimulated by the appearance of the sun, in nocturnal species, activity is highly impacted by the degree of moon light available. The presence of a new moon has correlated with inhibition of activity in night monkeys who exhibit lower levels of activity with decreasing levels of moon light. Therefore, the lunar cycle has a significant influence on the foraging and a nocturnal behaviors of night monkey species.\n\nNight monkeys are socially monogamous—they form a bond and mate with one partner. They live in small groups consisting of a pair of reproductive adults, one infant and one to two juveniles. These species exhibit mate guarding, a practice in which the male individual will protect the female he is bonded to and prevent other conspecifics from attempting to mate with her.  Mate guarding likely evolved as a means of reducing energy expenditure when mating. As night monkey territories generally have some edge overlap, there can be a large number of individuals coexisting in one area which may make it difficult for a male to defend many females at once due to high levels of interspecific competition for mates. Night monkeys form bonded pairs and the energy expenditure of protecting a mate is reduced. Pair bonding may also be exhibited as a result of food distribution. In the forest, pockets of food can be dense or very patchy and scarce. Females, as they need energy stores to support reproduction are generally distributed to areas with sufficient food sources. Males will therefore also have to distribute themselves to be within proximity to females, this form of food distribution lends itself to social monogamy as finding females may become difficult if males have to constantly search for females which may be widely distributed depending on food availability that year.\n\nHowever, while this does explain social monogamy, it does not explain the high degree of paternal care which is exhibited by these primates. After the birth of an infant, males are the primary carrier of the infant, carrying offspring up to 90% of the time. In addition to aiding in child care, males will support females during lactation through sharing their foraged food with lactating females. Generally, food sharing is not observed in nature as the search for food requires a great degree of energy expenditure, but in the case of night monkey males, food sharing confers offspring survival advantages. As lactating females may be too weak to forage themselves, they may lose the ability to nurse their child, food sharing therefore ensures that offspring will be well feed. The act of food sharing is only observed among species where there is a high degree of fidelity in paternity. Giving up valuable food sources would not confer an evolutionary advance unless it increased an individual's fitness; in this case, paternal care ensures success of offspring and therefore increases the father's fitness.\n\nRecent studies have proposed that night monkeys rely on olfaction and olfactory cues for foraging and communication significantly more than other diurnal primate species. This trend is reflected in the species physiology; members of Aotidae possess larger scent perception organs than their diurnal counterparts. The olfactory bulb, accessory olfactory bulb and volume of lateral olfactory tract are all larger in Aotus than in any of the other new world monkey species. It is therefore likely that increased olfaction capacities improved the fitness of these nocturnal primate species; they produced more offspring and passed on these survival enhancing traits. The benefits of increased olfaction in night monkeys are twofold; increased ability to use scent cues has facilitated night time foraging and is also an important factor in mate selection and sexual attractivity.\n\nAs a substantial portion of the night monkey's activities occurring during the dark hours of the night, there is a much lower reliance of visual and tactile cues. When foraging at night, members of the family Aotidae will smell fruits and leaves before ingesting to determine the quality and safety of the food source. As they are highly frugivorous and cannot perceive colour well, smell becomes the primary determinant of the ripeness of fruits and is therefore an important component in the optimal foraging methods of these primates. Upon finding a rich food source, night monkeys have been observed scent marking not only the food source, but the route from their sleeping site to the food source as well. Scent can therefore be used as an effective method of navigation and reduce energy expenditure during subsequent foraging expeditions. Night monkeys possess several scent glands covered by greasy hair patches, which secrete pheromones that can be transferred onto vegetation or other conspecifics. Scent glands are often located subcaudal, but also occur near the muzzle and the sternum. The process of scent marking is accomplished through the rubbing of the hairs covering scent glands onto the desired “marked item”.\n\nOlfactory cues are also of significant importance in the process of mating and mate guarding. Male night monkeys will rub subcaudal glands onto their female partner in a process called “partner marking” in order to relay the signal to coexisting males that the female is not available for mating. Night monkeys also send chemical signals through urine to communicate reproductive receptivity. In many cases, male night monkeys have been observed drinking the urine of their female mate; it is proposed that the pheromones in the urine can indicate the reproductive state of a female and indicate ovulation. This is especially important in night monkeys as they cannot rely on visual cues, such as the presence of a tumescence, to determine female reproductive state. Therefore, olfactory communication in night monkeys is a result of sexual selection; sexually dimorphic trait conferring increased reproductive success. This trait demonstrates sexual dimorphism, as males have larger subcaudal scent glands compared to female counterparts and sex differences have been recorded in the glandular secretions of each sex. There is a preference for scents of a particular type; those which indicate reproductive receptivity, which increases species fitness by facilitating the production of offspring.\n\nAccording to the IUCN (the International Union for Conservation of Nature), the Peruvian night monkey is classified an Endangered species, four species are Vulnerable, four are Least-concern species, and two are data deficient. Most night monkey species are threatened by varying levels of habitat loss throughout their range, caused by agricultural expansion, cattle ranching, logging, armed conflict, and mining operations. To date, it is estimated that more than 62% of the habitat of the Peruvian night monkey has been destroyed or degraded by human activities. However, some night monkey species have become capable of adapting exceptionally well to anthropogenic influences in their environment. Populations of Peruvian night monkey have been observed thriving in small forest fragments and plantation or farmland areas, however this is likely possible given their small body size and may not be an appropriate alternate habitat option for other larger night monkey species. Studies have already been conducted into the feasibility of agroforestry; plantations which simultaneously support local species biodiversity. In the case of A. miconax, coffee plantations with introduced shade trees, provided quality habitat spaces. While the coffee plantation benefited from the increased shade—reducing weed growth and desiccation, night monkeys used the space as a habitat, a connection corridor or stepping stone area between habitats that provided a rich food source. However, some researchers question the agroforestry concept, maintaining that monkeys are more susceptible to hunting, predator and pathogens in plantation fields, thus indicating the need for further research into the solution before implementation.\n\nNight monkeys are additionally threatened by both national and international trade for bushmeat and domestic pets. Since 1975, the pet trade of night monkeys has been regulated by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).  In the last forty years, nearly 6,000 live night monkeys and more than 7,000 specimens have been traded from the nine countries which they call home. While the restrictive laws put into place by CITES are aiding in the reduction of these numbers, 4 out of 9 countries, show deficiencies in maintaining the standards outlined by CITES Increased attention and enforcement of these laws will be imperative for the sustainability of night monkey populations.\n\nUse in biomedical research poses another threat to night monkey biodiversity. Species such as Nancy Ma's night monkey, like human beings, are susceptible to infection by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite responsible for malaria. This trait caused them to be recommended by the World Health Organization as test subjects in the development of malaria vaccines. Up to 2008, more than 76 night monkeys died as a result of vaccine testing; some died from malaria, while others perished due to medical complications from the testing.\n\nIncreased research and knowledge of night monkey ecology is an invaluable tool in determining conservation strategies for these species and raising awareness for consequences of the anthropogenic threats facing these primates. Radio-collaring of free ranging primates proposes a method of obtaining more accurate and complete data surrounding primate behavior patterns. This in turn can aid in understanding what measures need to be taken to promote the conservation of these species. Radio collaring not only allows for the identification of individuals within a species, increased sample size, more detailed dispersal and range patterns, but also facilitates educational programs which raise awareness for the current biodiversity crisis.  The usage of radio-collaring while potentially extremely valuable, has been shown to interfere with social group interactions, the development of better collaring techniques and technology will therefore be imperative in the realisation and successful use of radio collars on night monkeys.",

      "sections":"The bushy-tailed opossum is the sole member of Glironia, and is placed in the family Didelphidae. It was first described by English zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1912. Earlier, Glironia was considered part of the subfamily Didelphinae. A 1955 revision of marsupial phylogeny grouped Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Dromiciops (monito del monte) and Glironia under a single subfamily, Microbiotheriinae, noting the dental similarities among these. A 1977 study argued that these similarities are the result of convergent evolution, and placed Caluromys, Caluromysiops and Glironia in a new subfamily, Caluromyinae. In another similar revision, the bushy-tailed opossum was placed in its own subfamily, Glironiinae.\n\nThe cladogram below, based on a 2016 study, shows the phylogenetic relationships of the bushy-tailed opossum.\n\nBushy-tailed opossum (Glironia venusta)\n\nBlack-shouldered opossum (Caluromyopsis irrupta)\n\nDerby's woolly opossum (Caluromys derbianus)\n\nBare-tailed woolly opossum (Caluromys philander)\n\nBrown-eared woolly opossum (Caluromys lanatus)\n\nKalinowski's mouse opossum (Hyladelphys kalinowskii)\n\nMarmosini\n\nDidelphini\n\nThylamyini\n\nThe generic name is a compound of the Latin glir (\"dormouse\") and Greek suffix -ia (pertains to \"quality\" or \"condition\").

The face is marked by two bold, dark stripes extending from either side of the nose through the eyes to the back of the ears. These stripes are separated by a thinner grayish white band, that runs from the midline of the nose to the nape of the neck. The texture of hairs ranges from soft to woolly; the hairs on the back measure 7 to 8 millimetres (0.28 to 0.31 in). Five nipples can be seen on the abdomen; it lacks a marsupium. The tail, 19.5 to 22.5 centimetres (7.7 to 8.9 in) long, becomes darker and less bushy towards the tip. Basically the same in color as the coat, the tip may be completely white or have diffuse white hairs.\n\nThe head-and-body length is typically between 16 and 20.5 centimetres (6.3 and 8.1 in), the hindfeet measure 2.7 to 3.1 centimetres (1.1 to 1.2 in) and the ears are 2.2 to 2.5 centimetres (0.87 to 0.98 in) long. It weighs nearly 140 grams (4.9 oz). The dental formula is 5.1.3.44.1.3.4 – typical of all didelphids. Canines and molars are poorly developed. Differences from Marmosa species (mouse opossums) include smaller ears, longer and narrower rostrum, and greater erectness in canines. The monito del monte has a similar bushy tail. A study of the male reproductive system noted that the bushy-tailed opossum has two pairs of bulbourethral glands, as in Caluromys and Gracilinanus, but unlike other didelphids that have three pairs. The urethral grooves of the glans penis end near the tips.\n\nLittle is known of the behavior of the bushy-tailed opossum. Less than 25 specimens are known. A study noted the morphological features of the opossum that could allow for powerful movements during locomotion, and deduced that it is arboreal (tree-living).

The numbers of steppe lemmings vary greatly according to climatic conditions and the availability of food. Migrations are observed during years of mass outbreaks.\n\nIt is the most common domestic vole, being particularly well known in Europe. (In the US and Canada, it is still considered an exotic animal.)\n\nIn captivity, they can live over two years, but they are usually mistreated with small cages (A suitable space larger than average is best for a colony of rodents) and improper diets. Although the steppe lemming is social by nature and should not be held in captivity alone, if a colony of steppe lemmings is held together for a long period of time (two to three months) they may become hostile to each other (mainly to the subordinate members of the colony).  If there is only one separate nesting area, two entrances or exits should be placed, due to the attack style of the more impetuous lemmings. They also tend to be very territorial animals, so a low male population is best in captivity. Overall, three to eight steppe lemmings in one cage or aquarium is ideal, with no more than one male for every two or three females.\n\nStandard rodent food containing bits of dried fruit is not appropriate; as their natural diets do not contain much sugar, steppe lemmings are somewhat diabetic, and become sick or even die from overdosing on sugar. A sugar-free, no molasses food that does not contain dried fruit and little sunflower and other oily seeds should be used; laboratory rodent foods may be a cheap alternative. Additionally, steppe lemmings need grass and other leafy greens, such as alfalfa, to thrive.\n\nGrass gathered outdoors may harbor parasites and toxins and should not be used unless gathered from meadows away from inhabited areas, roads and not frequented by dogs or used for grazing. No matter where any grass or moss has been obtained, and even if it is only intended for bedding, it should be kept in a freezer for three days to eliminate parasites such as lice and mites.\n\nClean water should be always available; the amount actually drunk varies with the food consumed. Willow twigs need to be provided for abrading the continuously growing teeth. Lemmings can drink from a shallow dish, but since they typically track their bedding into the water, a bottle with a ball valve is better.\n\nLemmings enjoy any kind of running or climbing; however, as their habitat is essentially flat and rather featureless terrain, they have a poor sense of height and danger, so their enclosures should not be high enough to allow them to fall more than 10–15 cm and should, of course, be lined with wood chips and hay. An exercise wheel is the best way to keep the animals busy and trim, and if the wheels afford enough space, they will often race in it together. (However, fights can often develop around wheels - with males, particularly, it is helpful to have several wheels, perhaps even one for each lemming.)\n\nIn general, steppe lemmings are friendly animals and prefer to live in colonies. Even small groups of males (preferably from the same litter) can live quite peacefully. However, males do tend to be territorial and a mature alpha male will nearly always attack a stranger and will often mistreat other members of his own litter, particularly if the nest is overcrowded. A large, well-filled terrarium (about 5–10 cm wood chips covered by about 10 cm of hay) can allow a group to live far more peacefully; altercations should be expected in smaller spaces with little bedding.\n\nFights (as well as unintentional accidents) can also occur in and around exercise wheels.\n\nOnce a male has become aggressive - even with an outsider - he should be considered dangerous, watched very closely and - if possible - be neutered and placed with a group of females. Although neutering a lemming is a difficult operation typically attempted only by veterinary hospitals, it is possible.  A neutered alpha male will generally not become less aggressive toward other males.\n\nThe aggressor will try to trap the defending lemming in a corner and then attack with his teeth and short claws. Excited chirps, chattering and running typically accompany a fight - in most cases, the whole colony will be disturbed. (While activity of this kind is amusing for new owners, it should be observed very carefully, since peaceful lemming colonies are much quieter than ones characterized by aggressive behavior.)\n\nSince lemmings like to nest in small, narrow enclosures (like boxes the size of a fist), it is important for the enclosure have a second exit, so the defender can escape into another part of the terrarium. Lemming fights sometimes leave no exterior signs of violence, but can cause fatal internal bleeding. More often, fights result in lacerations, often around the hind legs, bottom and genitals.\n\nLemmings hurt in a fight should be placed in terraria or cages separate from the aggressor as soon as possible. Also, their natural tendency to scratch and lick at wounds can cause slow healing. A veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics and infection retardants to help an injured lemming, generally at reasonable costs. While it can be very difficult to convince an injured lemming to drink its medicated drops or eat food laced with medicine, a good trick is to place drops of medicine on the lemming's nose. Through licking itself clean, the lemming will ingest the medicine.",

It generally lives near water and is active at night, dawn or dusk. It eats mice, insects and crabs. Like all opossums, it is a marsupial and carries its young in a pouch.",
      "sections":"The big lutrine opossum (\"lutrine\" means \"otter-like\" and \"crass\" meaning \"thick, fat\" and \"cauda\" meaning \"tail\") is a very peculiar opossum, having a long weasel-like body, short legs, small rounded ears, and dense reddish or yellowish fur.  Nocturnal and crepuscular, they generally live in grasslands and savannas near water.  They are terrestrial but are excellent swimmers and climbers.\n\nThe big lutrine opossum is distributed in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Colombia and Guyana. Populations in the two last countries are isolated from the populations of all the other countries. It can be found in grasslands, savanna grassland, and gallery woodlands with permanent water bodies, in marshy or riparian habitats.\n\nThe big lutrine opossum builds tight nests made of grass and reeds or utilize abandoned armadillo or viscacha burrows.\n\nWith a skull adapted for carnivory, the big lutrine opossum is carnivorous and insectivorous feeding on small rodents and lagomorphs, birds, insects, small crustaceans. It is considered to be the most carnivorous of all the members of the order Didelphimorphia. It preys on venomous snakes. Captive individuals have been observed eating butterfish mixed with meat, frogs, earthworms, shrimp and mice. Big lutrine opossums living close to urban areas scavenge through garbage, but this behavior is isolated and likely occurs due to necessity because there is less available prey in urban areas.\n\nBreeding begins in September and carries on until April followed by approximately five months of anestrous, or time without estrus. Big lutrine opossums have two breeding periods per year resulting in litters of 7–11 offspring.  Like most marsupials, litters are born into a pouch and are fed via lactation until the offspring is developed enough to leave the pouch.  Gestation lasts approximately two weeks and young are weaned off mother's milk at around three months.  The first litter is born in September and the second in December or January.  The offspring from this breeding season reach sexual maturity at six months but do not begin reproducing until the following year.  Males are heavier than females indicating sexual dimorphism likely caused by male-male competition for mates.[citation needed]\n\nThe big lutrine opossum is quadrupedal and extremely agile. It is primarily terrestrial but also an adept climber and swimmer. Its long body, proportionally short limbs, and no undulation of the vertebral column disqualifies it from being categorized as a specialized semi-aquatic mammal. Although it cannot be classified as a truly specialized mammal, it is a strong swimmer drawing power from the hind limbs as the forelimbs paddle.  By employing a variety of gaits its locomotion abilities allows it to run, walk, climb, swim through all the different kinds of obstacles found in the grassy-woodland and marshy areas in which it lives. It can dive and swim with ease, expanding its prey base to aquatic invertebrates.\n\nFossils found in Minas Gerais, Brazil indicate that the big lutrine opossum emerged in the late Pleistocene epoch.  Lutreolina fossils found in Tarija, Bolivia as well as samples uncovered across Argentina also indicate appearance of lutrine opossum ancestors during the late Pleistocene.  For a short time in Argentina, the opossums were hunted for their pelts for fur trade and to line garments, but this market quickly declined because the color of the opossum pelts would fade over time.\n\nGenetic and morphological studies indicate that the population in the Yungas, which was formerly considered a population of L. crassicaudata (with both species being grouped under the common name \"lutrine opossum\"), is in fact a distinct species, Massoia's lutrine opossum (Lutreolina massoia). As its name suggests, the big lutrine opossum is larger than Massoia's lutrine opossum.",

Araneus ventricosus' venom is effective against invertebrate prey, but its venom is ineffective in vertebrates. This arachnid's silk has been researched extensively and has several unique properties. For instance, Araneus ventricosus is able to produce flagelliform silk, and its TuSp1 (tubuliform spidroin) and AcSp1 (aciniform spidroin) genes have been sequenced. The spider also has unique eyes that are affected by their circadian rhythm and imply the existence of an efferent optic nerve within the species' central nervous system.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Araneus ventricosus is commonly brown, black, or gray. It is also identifiable by its characteristic web-building behavior, as the arachnid is known to build a web throughout the night before destroying it in the morning. The spider is also known to perform mating dances as a courtship ritual.\n\nThe spider feeds on other animals in Arthropoda, primarily insects as an adult, and is not dangerous to humans, but has been reported to bite pets and other animals. The venom of Araneus ventricosus has different effects on spider bite victims depending on the bitten animal's taxonomy. While the venom has been found to be inactive in vertebrates, it is easily capable of killing insects. De novo sequencing of the Araneus ventricosus venom was even able to find evidence of glutamic acid methylation, which had not been found in animal venom before, while a local venom protein database (LVPD) recognized 130 protein chains related to toxins.\n\nThis species has several unique classifications taxonomically. Excluding the information provided in the chart, Araneus ventricosus is also included in the Entelygynae subgroup of Araneomorphae, as well as Orbicularae, which is a group branching from Entelygynae. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Araneus ventricosus was established and published in 2020, from which it was determined that the spider's codon arrangement was almost the same as Argiope bruennichi. This was able to then solidify that the Arachnida class is monophyletic.\n\nThe spider primarily resides in garden, fields, and forest ecosystems. When considering the spider's global distribution, it is commonly found in East Asia. Specific countries in which it is primarily spotted include China, North and South Korea, and Japan.\n\nAraneus ventricosus is able to produce flagelliform silk, also known as dragline silk, which has been found to be the most elastic of all spider silk types. However, this highly valuable silk type is very difficult to create through artificial means. Since spider silk has a variety of potential uses, including in fabrics and biomedical technologies, the sequence motifs for genes coding for this silk in the species have been studied to examine the potential for artificial production. In the study by Lee et al., clones of the genes for this silk were produced and injected into insect cells to determine if future cells would also contain these genetic motifs. Since the later generations of this strain of cells were able to maintain the AvFlag tag, it was discovered that the species could potentially be used to produce large quantities of this dragline spider silk.\n\nThe spidroins that make up all types of spider silk are produced by glands. In orb-weaving spiders, like Araneus ventricosus, there are typically seven or fewer of these glands. The silk proteins created by the glands include flagelliform spidroins, called Flag; tubuliform spidroins, called TuSp; aciniform spidroins, called AcSp; aggregate spidroins, called AgSp; pyriform spidroins, called PySp; and major and minor ampullate spidroins, respectively called MaSp and MiSp. Of these proteins, AcSp and TuSp help to create egg coverings, while the other five are involved in the spider silk's structure. However, thanks to recent analysis of the Araneus ventricosus genome, it has been discovered that there may be more than these seven spidroin types.\n\nTubuliform silk, which may also be called cylindriform silk, is used to develop egg coverings, so it is only produced by glands in female spiders. One specific tubuliform spidroin gene in Araneus ventricosus, TuSp1, has been studied using a long distance polymerase chain reaction. Through this study, it was found that 1921 amino acid residues with 9 collective repeats can be coded for by the gene's main component.\n\nAciniform silk, on the other hand, is involved in prey-wrapping behaviors along with creating egg coverings. With these two uses, this form of spider silk is much stronger and more flexible than most other silk types, making it a valuable research subject. For instance, similarly to the TuSp1 gene, a long distance PCR was performed on the gene for the aciniform spidroins in Araneus ventricosus, AcSp1. This procedure found that AcSp1 produces a protein with 3445 amino acids and contains 10338 base pairs.\n\nOrb-weavers' anterior median eyes have three types of eye cells - blue, ultraviolet, and green. In noct-diurnal spiders, meaning those active during both the day and night, the blue eye cells have been found to be most responsive to circadian systems. In the nocturnal Araneus ventricosus, it has then been found that their anterior median eyes are able to change sensitivity in accordance with their circadian rhythm, meaning that the spider likely has an efferent optic nerve. Additionally, their eyes are unable to find differences in color and have only one type of photoreceptor.\n\nThe central nervous system of Araneus ventricosus contains fused supraesophageal ganglia, which are then composed of substantially-sized clusters of neurons. These supraesophageal ganglia eventually lead to the spider's four pairs of eyes through the optic nerve. The leading portion of the nerve cord then consists of the subesophageal ganglia, including the ventral subesophageal mass. The subesophageal ganglia, unlike the supraesophageal ganglia, are responsible for the nerves tied to the spider's appendages and pedipalps. Furthermore, the Araneus ventricosus subesophageal mass and brain both lack soma, or cell bodies, in the neurons of their central fibrous masses.",

It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus as Didelphis philander in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758). It was given its present binomial name, Caluromys philander, by American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen in 1900. A 1955 revision of marsupial phylogeny grouped Caluromys, Caluromysiops, Dromiciops (monito del monte) and Glironia (bushy-tailed opossum) under a single subfamily, Microbiotheriinae, noting the dental similarities among these. A 1977 study argued that these similarities are the result of convergent evolution, and placed Caluromys, Caluromysiops and Glironia in a new subfamily, Caluromyinae. In another similar revision in 2009, the bushy-tailed opossum was placed in its own subfamily, Glironiinae.\n\nThe following four subspecies are recognized:\n\nThe cladogram below, based on a 2016 study, shows the phylogenetic relationships of the bare-tailed woolly opossum.\n\nBushy-tailed opossum (Glironia venusta)\n\nBlack-shouldered opossum (Caluromyopsis irrupta)\n\nDerby's woolly opossum (Caluromys derbianus)\n\nBare-tailed woolly opossum (Caluromys philander)\n\nBrown-eared woolly opossum (Caluromys lanatus)\n\nKalinowski's mouse opossum (Hyladelphys kalinowskii)\n\nMarmosini\n\nDidelphini\n\nThylamyini\n\nThe bare-tailed woolly opossum is characterized by a brown to gray coat, gray head, orange to gray underside and a partially naked tail furry at the base. A distinctive, narrow dark brown stripe runs between the eyes and the ears, from the tip of the nose to the back of the ears. Similar but broad streaks run from brown rings around either eye. Grayish fur separates these stripes from one another. Ears are large and almost always hairless. The coat is thick, soft and woolly; the flanks may be grayer than the back. The dorsal hairs continue up to 5–7 centimetres (2.0–2.8 in) onto the tail, after which it is naked, as the name suggests. The tail is dark brown towards the end, spotted with white and dark brown, terminating in a white or yellowish-white tip.\n\nThe size appears to decrease from Venezuela to Suriname; the mean weight is 170 grams (6.0 oz) in Venezuela and 250 grams (8.8 oz) in Suriname. The head-and-body length is typically between 16 and 26 centimetres (6.3 and 10.2 in). The ears measure 3 to 3.5 centimetres (1.2 to 1.4 in), the tail 25 to 36 centimetres (9.8 to 14.2 in) and the hind feet 3.2 to 3.9 centimetres (1.3 to 1.5 in). The dental formula is 5.1.3.44.1.3.4 – typical of didelphids.\n\nThe bare-tailed woolly opossum is nocturnal (active mainly at night), and thus difficult to observe or capture. Nevertheless, it is one of the very few opossums that have been successfully studied in detail. A study showed that activity of bare-tailed woolly opossums can be affected by the extent of moonlight. While activity in males dropped from new moon to full moon (that is, with increasing exposure to moonlight), activity in females remained largely unaffected. The opossum is arboreal (tree-living) and a good climber. A study showed that the tail, being prehensile, can act as an additional limb for locomotion, avoiding falls and carrying leaves to build nests. It builds nests with dry leaves in tree cavities.\n\nIndividuals tend to be aggressive to one another; hisses, grunts and even distress calls accompany agonistic behavior. Largely solitary, the only interactions observed are between mother and juveniles and in a mating pair. In a primary forest of French Guiana, the mean home range size was calculated as 3 hectares (0.012 sq mi). Ranges of both sexes overlapped extensively. The size of home ranges is influenced by environmental factors such as forage availability and individual needs. 'Click's are a common vocalization, produced by the young as well as adults. Bare-tailed woolly opossums, like other Caluromys species, will bite on being handled or to escape predators. Predators include the jaguarundi and margay. The Bare-tailed woolly opossum is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite Gigantorhynchus lutzi.\n\nAn omnivore, the bare-tailed woolly opossum feeds on fruits, vegetables, gum, flowers, nectar, arthropods (such as beetles, butterflies and other insects), other small invertebrates, small birds and reptiles. A study of the foraging behavior of the bare-tailed woolly opossum and the sympatric kinkajou showed that both feed on a variety of plants, choose plants by their abundance, show similar preferences, and favor certain plant parts at certain times of the year. A notable difference between the two was that while the kinkajou focused on plants with a wide distribution, the bare-tailed woolly opossum also fed on less common plants.\n\nIn French Guiana, females mate successfully after they are a year old. Females can have three litters a year, unless food is scarce. Gestation lasts 25 days – the longest among didelphimorphs; the young come out of the pouch at three months and weaning occurs at four months. A study in French Guiana showed that development of the offspring is slow for the first 40 days, and then accelerates during the last 40 days. The litter size ranges from one to seven. Newborn weigh 200 milligrams (0.0071 oz), and their weight increases to 11 grams (0.39 oz) after weaning. After exiting the pouch, offspring are sheltered in nests, where the mother regularly visits them for nursing.\n\nThe bare-tailed woolly opossum inhabits subtropical forests, rainforests, secondary forests and plantations; it prefers dense cover, though it can be seen on canopies as well. It can occur up to an altitude of 1,200–1,800 metres (3,900–5,900 ft) above the sea level. The range extends from northern Venezuela eastward to northeastern and southcentral Brazil, and includes Guiana, French Guiana, Margarita Island, Trinidad, and Suriname. The IUCN classifies the bare-tailed woolly opossum as least concern, due to its wide distribution and presumed large population. The survival of this opossum is threatened by deforestation and habitat loss.",

Like other brown lemurs, this species is cathemeral (active during the day and the night), lives in social groups, primarily eats fruit, exhibits sexual dichromatism, and does not demonstrate female dominance.

Collectively, lemurs (infraorder Lemuriformes) are classified as strepsirrhine primates.  Originally listed as a subspecies of the common brown lemur (E. fulvus), the collared brown lemur was promoted to full species status in 2001 by biological anthropologist Colin Groves.\n\nAn adult collared brown lemur can reach a head-body length of 39 and 40 cm (15 and 16 in) and have a tail length of 50 and 55 cm (20 and 22 in) for an overall length of 89 and 95 cm (35 and 37 in).  It has an average body weight of 2.25 and 2.5 kg (5.0 and 5.5 lb), making it a medium-sized lemur.  The only form of sexual dimorphism exhibited by the collared brown lemur is dichromatism.  The following table illustrates the coloration differences between the sexes:\n\nIn the wild, the collared brown lemur's range does not overlap with other brown lemurs, so it is rarely confused with other species.  However, in captivity it can be easily confused with the gray-headed lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps) due to similar coloration.  The male collared brown lemur can be distinguished by their cream-colored or rufous beards, whereas the male gray-headed lemur has a white beard.  Females of these two species are nearly indistinguishable, even though genetic analyses support full species status for both taxa. In Berenty Reserve, the species has hybridized with the red lemur.\n\nFound in tropical moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, the collared brown lemur occurs west to the forests of Kalambatritra and in the south from Tôlanaro north to the Mananara River. The Mananara River is the boundary between the ranges of the collared brown lemur and the gray-headed lemur to the north. The collared brown lemur can be found in the littoral forests of Mandena Conservation Zone, Sainte Luce Reserve, and Andohahela National Park.\n\nIn its environment, the collared brown lemur acts as a seed disperser, and is especially critical for the dispersal of large-seeded fruiting trees within its range.  However, there is no evidence that these relationships are coevolutionary and instead these lemurs may be the last remaining seed dispersers for these tree species following the extinction of larger frugivorous birds and subfossil lemurs.\n\nVery little is known about the natural history of this species.  It shows great dietary flexibility, feeding on fruits from over 100 plant species. It is also cathemeral (active both day and night throughout the year), a trait seen in some other members of its genus.  Research has suggested that metabolic dietary-related needs are the leading factor behind this behavior, although the specific hours of this activity pattern can shift based on lunar luminosity and seasonal changes in the photoperiod (day length).  Previous studies had ruled out effects of predators on the expression of this trait, and instead pointed to fruit availability and fiber intake as more important factors.\n\nThe collared brown lemur tends to live in social groups that are multi-male/multi-female, with groups ranging in size from two to seventeen individuals.  Population densities are estimated at 14 individuals/km2, and it appears to be common within its range.  Females give birth to one offspring between October and December, and male involvement with the young has been observed. Female dominance, a common behavioral trait in many lemur species but uncommon in most true lemurs, has not been observed in this species.\n\nBrown lemurs at Berenty (hybrid E. fulvus x collaris)  show linear hierarchy, adult female dominance, and the presence of conciliatory behavior after aggressions. Additionally, stress levels (measured via self-directed behaviors) decrease at the increase of the hierarchical position of individuals within the social group and reconciliation is able to bring stress down to the baseline levels.\n\nThe collared brown lemur was listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List assessment. Its greatest threat is habitat loss from slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production.  It is also hunted for food and captured for the local pet trade.  However, populations of the collared brown lemur have been successfully sustained in captivity and continue to provide a safeguard against their extinction.\n\nA small group of collared brown lemurs was introduced in the 1980s into the Berenty Private Reserve and has since hybridized with introduced red-fronted lemurs.",

It is superficially similar to the group of the night herons, but is active during daytime or at twilight.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The capped heron was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Ardea pileata in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The capped heron is now the only species placed in the genus Pilherodius that was erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek πιλος pilos \"cap\" and ερωδιος erōdios meaning \"heron\". The specific epithet pileatus is Latin for \"capped\".\n\nA molecular phylogenetic study published in 2023 found that the capped heron is sister to the whistling heron (Syrigma sibilatrix).\n\nThis species is very distinct from other herons, being the only one with a blue beak and face, and a black crown. The belly, chest, and neck are covered with yellowish-white or light-cream feathers. The wings and back are covered with white feathers. Three to four white long feathers extend from the black crown. No sexual dimorphism in color or brightness has been noted.\n\nThe body length of an adult varies between 510 and 590 mm, the wing chords between 263 and 280 mm, the tail between 95 and 103 mm, and the tarsus between 92 and 99 mm. The weight of an adult varies between 444 and 632 g.\n\nThe juveniles are very similar to the adults. They only differ in body length and that the white feathers are slightly grey.\n\nThe capped heron is endemic to the neotropics and almost exclusive to rainforest. It is present in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It inhabits low lands up to 900 m above sea level, though in Venezuela it is only found below 500 m, and in Ecuador below 400 m. Although there are no migrations registered to this species and it is believed that is sedentary, there may be seasonal movements in Darien, Panama.\n\nIt normally inhabits swamps and ditches in wet grasslands or rainforests. Sometimes it can venture into deeper ponds and rivers. It prefers to forage on the shore or in floating vegetation, but has also been observed in trenches of coffee plantations and flooded rice fields.\n\nCapped herons hunt mainly for fish, but also aquatic insects and larvae, tadpoles, and frogs. Fish taken as prey tend to be between 1 and 5 cm long. The insects are hunted in the nearby vegetation along the river or pond, and the fish in the shallow waters.\n\nIn a typical hunting sequence the heron will stand erectly searching for potential prey; after locating it they will crouch slowly and extend their neck; finally they will introduce their beak into the water at a great speed to catch the prey. The frequency of success observed is 23%. They can also use the same sequence while walking in the shallows. They usually walk slowly, covering the same area repeatedly pausing for a few seconds, then slowly moving one foot to take a new step. There are reports of individuals doing aerial hunting, peaking, gleaning, foot paddling, dipping, swimming feeding, and bill-vibrating.\n\nCapped herons move frequently between feeding sites, sometimes flying up to 100m. They may be crepuscular, but have been observed foraging during broad daylight, unlike the night-herons. They usually hunt solitarily.\n\nThere is very little known about the reproduction of this species. Captive breeding in Miami, USA indicates that a female may lay 2-4 dull white eggs, incubation lasts 26–27 days, and that the chick has white down. However, these captive individuals failed to have any young survive, possibly due to a deficient diet or abnormal behavior in the adults. Based on birds with a similar biology, it is likely that they maintain family groups and care for young even after the young have reached the fledgling stage. There may be a two-cycle breeding pattern, with northern and southern populations breeding at different times of the year.\n\nCapped herons are strongly territorial; the same bird may be seen at a foraging site for weeks at a time.  One capped heron was seen chasing another away from a foraging site, until the other bird settled high in a tree.\n\nThe capped heron is normally solitary, although there are cases where they have been found in couples or groups. Birds may be seen with other species such as snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), however other studies have found that they avoid large mixed-species flocks, appearing in fewer than 1% of 145 observed feeding aggregations. Capped herons appear to be submissive to great egrets (Ardea alba), but dominant to snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and striated herons (Butorides striatus).\n\nThis species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for a Vulnerable rating under the range-size criterion. The population size has not been quantified, and the trend is not known, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size or trend criteria. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. Nevertheless, it occurs in very low densities and is considered \"rare\" in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.\n\nThe capped heron appears to be adaptable and may be expanding its use of man-made habitats. People have found some individuals in pools along the Transamazonian Highway Brasil.  However, given that it is mainly a riverine forest species, the loss of this habitat due to logging and conversion of forest to pasture might pose long-term threats.",

Distantly related to elephants and sea cows, it comprises the four species in the genus Dendrohyrax, one of only three genera in the family Procaviidae, which is the only living family within the order Hyracoidea.\n\nThe four species are:\n\nAnalysis of calls found that they could be divided into 'shrieking' hyraxes and 'barking' hyraxes, with the barkers being a genetically distinct fourth species.\n\nThe tree hyrax has four-toed front feet and three-toed back feet with rounded nails, and rubbery soles that help it climb.",
      "sections":"Dependent on geographical location, their soft dense coats can range from a pale gray to light or dark brown. The variation is consistent with evolutionary development to aid with camouflage, so that in wetter regions with more verdant and abundant vegetation, they are darker, and in more arid areas, their colouring is lighter.\n\nThe habitat of the tree hyrax is mostly in forested places with a mix of older and younger trees. It can be found in elevations up to 4500 m above sea level.\n\nDespite being more common than the rock hyrax, the tree hyrax is much more difficult to spot, as it is both nocturnal and extremely shy.\n\nTree hyraxes are nocturnal, arboreal folivores, which make use of cavity-bearing trees as dens in forests whereforest fauna decreased due to the change in the structural nature of forests in Eastern Cape, South Africa. Studies which were used to study the specific habitat requirements of fauna in their forest, revealed that the tree hyrax was found to select for den trees with particular characteristics: seven tree species were selected as den trees, which were usually the tallest trees in the canopy 4–8 m. Den trees were usually only partly decayed, with multiple cavity entrances and trunk angles between 45 and 68°. Cavity entrance and orientation did not appear to play a role in den tree selection by Dendrohyrax spp.\n\nTree hyraxes were found to be active 16% of the time, during which feeding was their most dominant activity. They mostly feed themselves on leaves of Hagenia abyssinica. Of the 16% active time, 4% of the time was used travelling between trees predominantly during daylight hours. They have calling behavior that is strongly prevalent in the dry season. The hyrax calls regularly in the early evening, and often a second time later at night; during rains, though, their calls become infrequent.\n\nThe tree hyrax diet is plant-based and varies depending on geographical location. In one South African forest, their principal foods were Schotia latifolia, Cassine aethiopica, and Eugenia natalensis.\n\nEach of the four species of tree hyrax has a distinct territorial call. In D. validus, it starts with a series of loud, measured cracking sounds, sometimes compared to \"a huge gate with rusted hinges being forced open\". This is then followed by a series of \"unearthly screams\", ending in a descending series of expiring shrieks. Females also call, but lack the air pouches and enlarged larynges of the males, producing only a feeble imitation. Typically, two peak calling periods occur per night. Times vary, but the first period is often 2–3 hours after dark, and the second at some point after midnight.",

      "introduction":"\n\nSpecies synonymy\n\nGenus synonymy\n\nThe white worm beetle (Hylamorpha elegans) is a species of beetle in the family Scarabaeidae. It is the only species in the genus Hylamorpha. This beetle is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.\n\nThis beetle is recognized for its unique appearance and intriguing ecological role within its habitat as a decomposer.  Its glossy green exoskeleton, with variations in color across its head, pronotum, and elytra, makes it easily identifiable. It feeds on decaying organic matter, aiding in the breakdown of dead plant material. This process contributes to nutrient recycling and soil enrichment. This species is primarily nocturnal, so is often observed foraging for food at night.\n\nTheir mating behavior is influenced by host-plant volatiles, with males being attracted to females emitting specific pheromones while feeding on leaves. Once mating occurs, females lay eggs on preferred host plants, such as red clover.\n\nThese beetles are agricultural pests, causing damage to crops by feeding on grass and cereal roots in their larval stage. Additionally, they defoliate trees like Nothofagus species during adulthood, impacting forest ecosystems. Predators such as the black-faced ibis and rainbow trout contribute to controlling their population. Understanding their genetics, including chemoreception mechanisms mediated by odorant-binding proteins and chemoreceptors, provides insights into their behavior and potential management strategies. Their interactions with humans and livestock pose challenges in agriculture and forestry, driving the exploration of alternative pest management approaches like disrupting mating behavior or enhancing soil organic matter to reduce larval damage.",

      "sections":"The white worm beetle has a distinct appearance due to its long body, usually measuring between 11.8 to 18.2 millimetres (0.465 to 0.717 in) long, and 5.8 to 10.8 millimetres (0.228 to 0.425 in) wide across the shoulders. It showcases an oval physique and a smooth, glossy green exoskeleton. Its head, pronotum, and elytra (wing covers) can range from light to dark green, sometimes with shiny silver or bronze reflections, and rarely orange. Under certain conditions or after death, it can turn blue, red, orange, or purple.\n\nMales' front legs are usually green or light brown to match their body color. While females' front legs are mostly light brown, their back legs are green like their bodies. Male beetles have all green legs with a shiny appearance, especially on the middle and back legs, while females have green legs with varying degrees of shine. The ends of their front leg teeth are always black.\n\nThe beetle's head has small bumps or dots and is usually green or brown. Its antennae have ten sections, with one section longer in males than in females. The beetle's mandibles are triangular and end in a sharp or rounded point. Its back has tiny bumps or dots, and its sides have a small edge. The back legs and the lower body have long white hairs. The front legs have three small teeth at the end, and the back legs have a bump on the outer edge. The bottom part of the legs have small bumps, and the very last part of the body is slightly curved, both in males and females.\n\nSimilar to other scarab beetles, they likely rely on hygro and thermoreceptive sensilla to assess their surroundings. These sensory structures, such as sensilla coeloconica or sensilla styloconica, are known to respond to changes in humidity and temperature. This suggests that the beetle is adapted to habitats where these sensory cues play a significant role, favoring areas with specific moisture and temperature levels conducive to their emergence and activity.\n\nWhite worm adults typically emerge from the ground during the spring and summer, particularly when evenings are warmer.\n\nThe white worm beetle inhabits both sides of the Andes in central and southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. Its range notably corresponds to the distribution of Nothofagus species, which serve as its primary food source. It's an agricultural pest in Chile where the larvae feed on grain and the adults defoliate young trees.\n\nThe white worm beetle exhibits a broad diet encompassing various plant parts, making it a significant agricultural pest. In its larval stage, this beetle primarily feeds on the roots of grasses and small grain cereals, leading to severe agricultural damage in regions like Chile.\n\nAdditionally, during its adult stage, H. elegans occasionally causes significant defoliation on its secondary host plants, which predominantly include species of the genus Nothofagus, such as Nothofagus antarctica, betuloides, dombeyi, and obliqua. This feeding behavior can result in the death of young trees, particularly when there are large numbers of the white worm beetles on them.\n\nThis shift in dietary preference signifies a change in ecological niche and resource utilization as the beetle progresses through its life cycle.\n\nHylamorpha elegans larvae exhibit a selective feeding behavior, preferring particulate organic matter (POM) over fine organic matter particles for their nutritional requirements. This preference for POM suggests a specialized physiological adaptation to efficiently utilize certain types or qualities of organic matter present in the soil. The larvae's ability to selectively ingest POM indicates a sophisticated physiological mechanism for nutrient acquisition and energy metabolism.\n\nResearch indicates a strong correlation between larval growth and the quality of organic matter present in the soil rather than its quantity. Larvae feeding on soils rich in POM exhibit enhanced growth rates and increased live weight compared to those on soils with lower POM content, particularly evident in second instar larvae feeding on high POM soil. This underscores the importance of organic matter composition in facilitating optimal growth and development.\n\nThe physiological response of larvae to varying soil conditions is evident in their live weight dynamics over time. The study highlights that the magnitude of the effect of POM content on live weight varies at different sampling times, suggesting temporal variations in larval growth patterns in response to changes in soil quality. Furthermore, the growth rates of larvae feeding on soils with different POM contents exhibit significant differences, indicating distinct physiological responses to nutrient availability and organic matter composition.\n\nThird instar larvae feeding on soils with lower POM content exhibit diminished live weight compared to those on high POM soil, underscoring the influence of soil quality on larval development. The observed weight loss nearing pupation suggests a transition phase characterized by reduced feeding rates and metabolic adjustments, impacting larval growth dynamics.\n\nExploration of faecal production reveals physiological adjustments in nutrient utilization or metabolic processes during prolonged feeding periods, impacting faecal output in third instar larvae. While the POM content of soils does not significantly affect relative faecal weight per larva, the negative effect of feeding duration highlights the dynamic nature of larval physiology in response to changing environmental conditions.\n\nThe enemies of the Hylamorpha elegans beetle consist of avian predators such as the black-faced ibis (Theristicus melanopis). The black-faced ibis is known for its tactile, non-visual hunting strategy, utilizing its long and slender bill to probe the ground for prey such as H. elegans larvae and other terrestrial invertebrates.\n\nThe study found that larvae of H. elegans, commonly known as the southern green chafer, are among the important prey items consumed by the black-faced ibis. The green chafer larvae were found to provide a higher mean biomass and energetic content compared to other prey, making them a preferred food source for the ibis. H. elegans larvae are not immune to predation by the ibis.\n\nIn January, at Lago Traful in Argentina's Neuquén Province, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) prey on Hylamorpha elegans that inadvertently plummet into the lake from the overhanging Nothophagus trees. H. elegans is incredibly abundant along the shores of this lake and likely others.\n\nThe genetics of Hylamorpha elegans in the context of chemoreception is crucial for insect behavior such as host-seeking, mate finding, and aggregation. Chemoreception in insects involves specific proteins located in the antennae, particularly in hair-like sensory organs called sensilla. These proteins are responsible for recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the environment, and among them, odorant receptors (ORs) play a central role in transducing olfactory information toward the central nervous system of insects.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the genetic basis of chemoreception in coleopterans, including Hylamorpha elegans. While ORs have been the primary focus, attention has also been given to gustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs). A transcriptomic analysis of its antennal transcriptome revealed chemoreceptors ORs, GRs, and IRs. This analysis identified a total of 102 OR transcripts, 22 GR transcripts, and 14 IR transcripts for the species. The identification of these transcripts provides valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying chemoreception in H. elegans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis delineated five main clades corresponding to different sensory functions, including bitter, sugar, and carbon dioxide (CO2) reception. Transcript abundance analysis revealed HeleGR21a as the most abundant GR transcript, followed by HeleGR7, indicating their potential importance in chemosensory signaling.\n\nIonotropic receptors (IRs) play crucial roles in mediating olfactory and gustatory responses in insects. Transcriptomic analysis of H. elegans antennae identified 14 HeleIRs and 3 BpraIRs. These transcripts exhibited 3-4 transmembrane domains (TMDs) and were distributed across different clades associated with various sensory functions, including olfaction, hygrosensation, and thermosensation. Transcript abundance analysis revealed HeleIR8a, HeleIR25a, and HeleIR76b as the most abundant IR transcripts in H. elegans, highlighting their potential significance in chemosensory signaling pathways.\n\nOdorant receptors (ORs) are critical for detecting volatile compounds in the environment and are essential for various behaviors, including host-seeking and mating. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 65 OR transcripts plus Orco in H. elegans.\n\nThe presence of a larger number of GRs in H. elegans suggests a potential role in mediating feeding behaviors and host selection, consistent with the generalist feeding behavior observed in H. elegans. Furthermore, the identification of specific GRs associated with carbon dioxide detection implies their involvement in environmental sensing and possibly mate location.\n\nThe differential expression of ORs between male and female H. elegans suggests a potential role in sex-specific behaviors and reproductive strategies. Sex-biased expression analysis of selected ORs revealed differential expression patterns between male and female antennae, suggesting potential roles in mediating sex-specific behaviors or responses to environmental cues. HeleOR14, HeleOR64, and HeleOrco were significantly upregulated in female antennae, while HeleOR46 showed significant upregulation in male antennae. Similarly, BpraOR1 exhibited significant upregulation in female antennae, indicating potential differences in chemosensory responses between sexes. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of sex-specific behaviors and chemical communication in H. elegans and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying insect chemoreception.\n\nThe mating behavior of the white worm beetle is intricately linked to chemical communication facilitated by pheromones and sensory structures on their antennae. Virgin females release 1,4-hydroquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone, which are compounds that elicit attraction response from males. The ability of females to release these pheromones likely evolved as a mechanism to increase their reproductive success by attracting males for mating. On the other hand, males do not attract other males, indicating specific response to female cues. Olfaction plays a crucial role in scarab beetle mating behavior, aiding in the location of potential mates, food, and oviposition sites.\n\nMating behavior in H. elegans is notably influenced by host-plant volatiles, suggesting a mechanism by which adults locate potential mates. Male beetles exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize females while they are feeding on leaves, indicating the presence of sexual kairomones released by the attacked plants.\n\nAfter copulation, females of H. elegans engage in a distinct behavior of flying to specific crops, such as red clover (Trifolium pratense), to deposit their fertilized eggs. The seasonal flight period typically occurs from 11th November to 27th January. This oviposition behavior indicates a deliberate selection of oviposition sites, likely driven by volatile compounds emitted by preferred host plants.\n\nMales, equipped with a larger abundance of chemosensory sensilla on their antennae compared to females, demonstrate a heightened ability to detect pheromones, reflecting their active role in mate searching. Sensilla placodea, sensilla coeloconica, and sensilla basiconica are identified as the main sensory structures involved in chemoreception, particularly for detecting pheromones and plant volatiles.\n\nThis selective response to female odors suggests a form of sexual selection among males. Those individuals capable of detecting and responding to female pheromones may have a reproductive advantage by increasing their chances of encountering and mating with receptive females. Over time, this preference for specific chemical cues released by females may drive the evolution of male sensory mechanisms, enhancing their ability to locate mates in the environment.\n\nObservations suggest that mating encounters occur on foliage, where females remain feeding on host leaves, potentially enhancing male response towards the sex pheromone released by females. Compounds released from the host tree, such as those found in the essential oil of Nothofagus obliqua leaves, interact with female pheromones to increase male responsiveness. This behavior underscores the significance of plant volatiles in facilitating mating interactions.\n\nOne of the notable aspects of the white worm beetle is its reproductive behavior. During the mating season, males engage in elaborate courtship displays to attract females. Once mating occurs, females lay their eggs in moist soil or decaying vegetation, where the larvae hatch and develop.\n\nMale beetles exhibit pronounced dimorphism in flight behavior compared to females. Light trap data indicates that males are primarily involved in dispersal flights, as they are predominantly captured in traps. This suggests that males engage in active flight to search for mates. Females, on the other hand, are less frequently caught in light traps, indicating a more sedentary behavior that is likely associated with feeding on host leaves during the flight period.\n\nThe physiological aspects of Hylamorpha elegans, a native Chilean scarab beetle, are tied to its ecological interactions, particularly its olfactory perception and behavior. As a relevant agricultural pest, H. elegans exhibits cryptic habits, making conventional control methods challenging. Consequently, there's a pressing need for alternative, environmentally friendly strategies. Understanding the beetle's sensory mechanisms offers promising avenues for modifying its behavior. One key aspect of this is the study of odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which play a crucial role in the beetle's olfactory perception. These proteins, characterized by their structure and function, facilitate the recognition of odorants and their transport to olfactory receptors. Through the identification of OBPs and their interactions with volatile compounds released by its native host plant Nothofagus obliqua, researchers aim to uncover new semiochemicals that could potentially disrupt pest behavior.\n\nAmong the proteins involved in olfactory perception, OBPs stand out as crucial players. These small, soluble proteins are present in sensory organs and are characterized by their structure, which allows them to bind to odorant molecules. OBPs serve as carriers for lipophilic odorants, transporting them to olfactory receptors and initiating the olfactory process. Researchers aim to identify candidate compounds for pest control by leveraging the affinity of OBPs for specific odorants. By combining computational tools such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics, researchers can predict the interactions between OBPs and volatile compounds, providing insights into potential pest management strategies.\n\nThe focus on odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) sheds light on the beetle's olfactory perception mechanisms. Despite the prediction of six OBPs from the genome draft, only four were successfully amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cDNA extracted from adult individuals. Notably, these transcripts exhibited higher abundance in chemosensitive tissues compared to hindleg tibia, indicating their crucial role in olfactory processes. The characterized OBPs, namely HeleOBP1, HeleOBP3, HeleOBP4, and HeleOBP6, vary in length, isoelectric point (pI), and molecular mass, reflecting their diverse functions in odorant detection and discrimination.\n\nThe identification of four novel odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) in H. elegans represents a crucial advancement, particularly considering the limited genomic information available for scarab beetle species. RT-PCR analyses revealed that these OBPs are predominantly expressed in organs associated with olfactory and gustatory senses, indicating their pivotal role in chemosensation. Notably, HeleOBP1 and HeleOBP3 exhibit heightened expression levels in the antenna, suggesting their involvement in detecting semiochemicals relevant to host-seeking and oviposition behaviors. Conversely, HeleOBP4 and HeleOBP6 show increased expression in mouthparts, potentially implicating them in the perception of feeding-related cues. These tissue-specific expression patterns provide valuable insights into the functional roles of OBPs in mediating insect behaviors related to mating, feeding, and oviposition.\n\nThe discovery of novel volatile compounds from Nothofagus obliqua leaves further enriches our understanding of H. elegans physiology. Six compounds, including beta-myrcene, beta-ocimene, dodecane, tetradecane, alpha-gurjunene, and aromadendrene, were identified, expanding the repertoire of chemicals relevant to the beetle's olfactory perception and behavior. These compounds hold promise for future analysis aimed at elucidating their roles as attractants, repellents, or pheromones in H. elegans ecology and communication.\n\nIn the context of H. elegans, understanding the physiological basis of olfactory perception is essential for developing effective pest management techniques. By mining the beetle's genome and characterizing novel OBPs, researchers can uncover key insights into its sensory mechanisms. Furthermore, by elucidating the interactions between OBPs and volatile compounds released by its preferred host plant, researchers can identify potential disruptors of pest behavior.\n\nChemoreception, crucial for insect behavior such as host-seeking and mate finding, relies on specific proteins located in the Hylamorpha elegans’ antennae, particularly in sensilla, which are hair-like sensory organs. These proteins, including odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), and ionotropic receptors (IRs), play essential roles in detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the environment.\n\nOlfaction is implicated in foraging, host selection, mate finding, aggregation, and reproductive behaviors in numerous insect species. The comparative analysis of chemoreceptors, including gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and odorant receptors (ORs), sheds light on the molecular basis of olfactory perception in H. elegans. Notably, H. elegans has a larger number of identified GRs compared to Brachysternus prasinus, another South American scarab beetle that lives in similar areas as H. elegans. This larger number of identified GRs in H. elegans suggests a broader repertoire for detecting sugars from various tree species, potentially influencing feeding behavior, host selection, and defense mechanisms.\n\nIn the peripheral olfactory system, sensilla houses these chemoreceptors, which are responsible for recognizing and transducing olfactory information toward the central nervous system. Among these receptors, ORs are central to mediating various behavioral responses, such as attraction or repulsion, by transducing olfactory signals.\n\nGustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs) also contribute to chemoreception in insects. GRs are involved in recognizing a wide range of tastants, including bitter and sweet molecules, sugars, nutrients, and carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, IRs play diverse roles depending on the insect species, including thermal and water sensations, as well as avoidance behaviors, such as selecting oviposition sites.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of ionotropic receptors (IRs) reveals a diverse array of receptors in H. elegans, distributed across clades associated with gustation, olfaction, hygrosensation, and thermosensation. The presence of coreceptors such as HeleIR8a and HeleIR25a shows their importance in mediating chemosensory responses, with implications for environmental sensing and behavioral adaptations.\n\nSex-biased expression analysis of selected ORs provided insights into potential differences in olfactory sensitivity between male and female H. elegans. Significant expression differences were observed for certain ORs, indicating a role in mediating sex-specific behaviors or responses to environmental cues. The differential expression of ORs between male and female H. elegans suggests a role in sex-specific behaviors, including mate location and reproductive strategies.\n\nThe beetle poses significant challenges for both humans and livestock in Central and Southern Chile and Southwestern Argentina. The larvae of these beetles inflict severe agricultural damage by feeding on the roots of grasses and small grain cereals in Chile. The beetle is also a significant pest in berry crops and common hazel orchards, reducing crop yields and forage availability. Livestock grazing on pastures infested with these larvae may also experience indirect effects. Damage to pasture plants' roots can lead to reduced forage availability and quality, affecting livestock nutrition and productivity. Additionally, irregular outbreaks of H. elegans larvae in grasses and small grain cereals can be challenging for farmers and ranchers in maintaining viable pasturelands and cereal crops.\n\nAdditionally, their adult counterparts occasionally cause extensive defoliation on secondary host plants, particularly species of Nothofagus trees such as Nothofagus antarctica, betuloides, dombeyi, and obliqua. These adult beetles often congregate, feed, and mate in the canopy of these trees. This defoliation can result in the death of young trees.\n\nThe use of semiochemicals, such as pheromones and kairomones, for pest management has been poorly developed, adding to the challenge of mitigating their impact. Alternative strategies based on ethology, such as disrupting mating or host finding, are being explored as options for pest management. Studies have also shown that adding manure to soil, which increases the availability of labile organic matter such as particulate organic matter (POM), can reduce larval damage to pasture plants. The presence of POM may serve as an alternative food source for scarab larvae, potentially decreasing their intensity of feeding on plant roots.",

      "introduction":"\n\nCallosamia promethea, commonly known as the promethea silkmoth, is a member of the family Saturniidae, which contains approximately 1,300 species. It is also known as the spicebush silkmoth, which refers to one of the promethea silkmoth's common host plants, spicebush (Lindera benzoin). C. promethea is classified as a silk moth, which stems from its ability to produce silk, which it does in the formation of its cocoon. C. promethea lives in forests in the eastern U.S. and does not damage the trees on which it lives. The species was first described by Dru Drury in 1773.\n\nCallosamia promethea hatches from eggs and feeds on its host plants before pupating while hanging from trees during the winter. It then emerges and mates during a specific time of day. The females utilize pheromones to attract males for mating, with both sexes mating multiple times. They are the only moth in their family where the sexes are not active at the same time of day, with males being diurnal and females being nocturnal. They only overlap in activity for a few hours in the early evening. The males use mimicry of the poisonous pipevine swallowtail butterfly as a form of protection from predators.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The range of C. promethea extends the length of the east coast of the United States and west to the Great Plains. C. promethea is found in deciduous forests.\n\nOnce the caterpillars hatch, they are fairly solitary. They eat leaves from the edge inwards. The caterpillars eat from several host plants. Caterpillars begin as yellow with black stripes, but become blue green over time. Once they are blue green, they develop four red and one yellow protuberances. These caterpillars go through several instars or skin shedding, and usually after the fifth shedding the caterpillar is ready to form a cocoon. When the caterpillars form cocoons, they are twice as long as they are wide.\n\nThe wingspan of this moth is 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102 mm). Like most Lepidoptera, females are on average larger than males. Males are darkly pigmented, while females are more brightly colored. The males and females both have tan on the edges of their wings. The males have a set of eyespots on their forewings, but the females have spots on all their wings. In the northern part of the promethea silkmoth's range, there is one brood per year and it occurs during the early summer. In the southern part of the moth's range, there are two broods, with one occurring in the spring and the other occurring in late summer.\n\nFemale promethea silkmoths lay their eggs on the leaves of the host plants of the caterpillars. The eggs are laid at night. A female's eggs are laid in groups of 4 to 10 at a time. Eggs are white, flat and elliptical.\n\nSome caterpillars in the family Saturniidae will pupate in the ground. However, promethea silkmoth caterpillars pupate in trees. The caterpillars attach themselves directly to the branches of trees with their silk. Then, they curl a dead leaf around themselves. C. promethea pupates during the winter.\n\nThe location of the C. promethea cocoon typically provides the pupae with sufficient protection from possible predators. The cocoons hang from thin branches and are difficult to open, so mice may have difficulty predating because the branches are too thin to hold their weight and woodpeckers could have trouble opening the pupa. Other predators of the cocoons include some flies and wasps.\n\nCallosamia promethea utilizes Batesian mimicry, in which an edible species mimics a toxic species as a form of protection from predators. Promethea silkmoth females are rust and cream colored, but the males have very different coloration. Promethea silkmoth males mimic the pipe vine swallowtail (Battus philenor), a poisonous butterfly. The topside of the wings of promethea silkmoth males is black, as are the wings of the pipe vine swallowtails, which also have a shiny blue pattern on the top surface of their wings. The promethea silkmoth males do not have this reflective blue pattern, but their mimicry is still effective due to the fact that the blue reflective pattern is only visible on pipe vine swallowtails in a certain light, so the blue is not essential for C. promethea's mimicry to be effective.\n\nThe effectiveness of this mimicry was tested experimentally. Promethea silkmoth males were painted with various patterns, then released, and the amount of each group that was recaptured showed that mimicry helped the moths survive. The control group was painted black, to match their actual coloration. One experimental group was painted black and yellow to mimic the tiger swallowtail (Papilio glaucus), which is not a poisonous butterfly and does not mimic the poisonous pipe vine swallowtail. The other experimental group was painted with orange stripes to mimic the poisonous monarch butterfly. The two groups that were painted to be mimetic to a poisonous butterfly both were recaptured more than the group painted to match an edible butterfly. This shows that mimicry, specifically the partial mimic of promethea silkmoth males to pipe vine swallowtails, is adequate protection against predation.\n\nFemale promethea silkmoths release pheromones to attract males. The females remain in place, camouflaged, as they wait for the males to sense their pheromones and come to them. Females release their pheromones at a specific time of day called the \"calling time\". For C. promethea this time is late afternoon and into the early evening. When males sense the pheromones of a female they travel up the gradient of the pheromones and towards the female. Males are able locate females from miles away. One C. promethea male has been found to be able to detect and find a female from 23 miles away. A distance this long is likely to be covered in multiple days.\n\nIn terms of locating mates, males cannot find females unless they release pheromones, so the females control how frequently they mate. When females do send out their pheromones, the first male to reach a female will mate with her.\n\nCallosamia promethea are polyandrous, meaning the females mate with multiple males. However, not all females practice this behavior, some only mating with a single male. They are the only moth in the family Saturniidae known to be polyandrous. This is likely because C. promethea is the only moth that is both diurnal (males) and nocturnal (females). This allows for egg laying and mating to occur at different times of day, so there is no trade off between the two activities. Male moths are polygamous, as well.

      "sections":"The American green tree frog is moderately sized. It has long legs, a streamlined and slender build, and smooth skin. The American green tree frog ranges from 3.2 to 6.4 centimetres (1+1⁄4 to 2+1⁄2 in) in length. For perspective on the growth of juveniles, recently metamorphosed \"young-of-the-year\" were found to be about 20.6 mm.\n\nTheir dorsum can range in color from the more common bright green to reddish-brown. Such a range in coloration may result in the frog being mistaken for other species. Some evidence suggests that green tree frogs can exhibit a color change in response to their background and/or temperature.\n\nThe dorsum is peppered with small golden spots, and the frogs have a white to cream coloration on their ventral side. American green tree frogs also contain white prominent lateral stripes.\n\nThey are normally ectothermic and heterothermic.\n\nThe American green tree frog weighs on average 3.76g with a range between 2.15g and 5.11g. Female frogs are usually larger than males. Larger males tend to have an upper hand in attracting females than smaller males either through increased physical strength in duels or more pronounced call signals during mating competition.\n\nThe American green tree frog is found in the central and southeastern United States with a geographic range from the Eastern Shore of Maryland to southeast Florida with populations as far west as central Texas and as far north as Delaware and southern New Jersey, though the size of its distribution may be larger or vary seasonally. They are indigenous to the coastal plains of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and all of Florida. The American green tree frog is considered monotypic, but clinal variation has been observed from Florida north along the Atlantic coastal plain. This may be attributed to the result of strong selection and/or drift.\n\nAmerican green tree frogs prefer to live in open canopy forests with a permanent water source and filled with plentiful vegetation. The species is found in both natural and settled environments, often being sighted in backyards with ponds, in garages or garden structures. The species commonly resides in cypress ponds, water lily prairies, and marshes. They are often found perched on twigs, low branches, and grasses.\n\nA growing number of American green tree frogs have experienced severe habitat loss primarily due to urbanization and destructive wildfires that can destroy forest canopy cover. Since most amphibians have narrow habitat tolerances and migration constraints, American green tree frogs urgently need alternative shelters for survival as forest canopies recover. In a study from Central Texas, scientists have tried to combat wildfire habitat loss by creating artificial shelters using PVC pipes.Wetlands that the American green tree frogs occupy for breeding have had an increase in salinity and an increase in pesticide concentration in recent years due to urbanization. This has proven to have a negative effect on sperm mobility and has reduced reproductive success\n\nOne study finds that there are at least 31 tree frog species of the genus Hyla (or Dryophytes) in North America, Central America, and Eurasia. Examples include both the H. gratiosa and H. walkeri. While many tree frogs reside in the New World, a notable number of frogs inhabit the Eurasia continent and display unique biogeographic patterns based on an analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences.\n\nAmerican green tree frogs will defend their mate calling sites against foreign rivals and invaders using aggressive interactions. Such behaviors include a combination of aggressive call signals and wrestling from males.\n\nAmerican green tree frogs are insectivores, primarily consuming flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers, cockroaches, spiders, beetles, and other small insects such as crickets and ants. One study suggested frogs select prey not by their size, but according to their activity levels, with the most active prey being the most frequently eaten. The same study showed \"nearly 90% of Hyla cinerea prey were actively pursued\", with the other 10% being \"insects walking or close enough to be snatched up by the frog's tongue\". Another study showed that it is not uncommon for American green tree frogs to ingest plant material.\n\nBecause the species is small and easily frightened, they often do not do well with frequent handling. Some specimens do seem to tolerate it occasionally, so handling frequency should be determined on an individual basis. The American green tree frog tends to be nocturnal, so they will be most active once the lights are off. Males call most of the year, especially after being misted in their tank.\n\nMost American green tree frog females breed once per year, but some have multiple clutches in a single mating season. In a Florida population, \"advertisement calls of males were documented between March and September and pairs in amplexus were observed between April and August\". The average number of eggs in a single clutch was observed to be about 400 for this specific population. In a population in Florida where conditions were better, clutch size averaged over 1,200. Eggs take between 4 and 14 days to hatch, with an average of five days. According to the Animal Diversity Web at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, \"Female size was positively correlated with clutch size, but after the initial clutch, the number of eggs nearly always decreased\".\n\nTadpoles are green with a yellow or white stripe extending from each nostril to the eye and may have mottled tail fins. American green tree frogs show only the parental investment of mating and egg-laying.\n\nBreeding is known to be strongly influenced by day length, temperature, and precipitation. While the influence of these factors with respect to breeding is not well understood, it is well documented, as the frogs generally breed following rainfall and males call more frequently as temperature and day length increase. The green tree frog is the only species in the hyla genus in the southeastern U.S. that commonly breeds around predatory fish habitats. Some evidence demonstrates that the length of the breeding season is correlated with latitude; seasonal length decreases as latitude increases due to temperature limitations.\n\nTo attract mates, the male American green tree frog uses a distinctive advertisement call which is noticeably different from its release or warning calls.[citation needed]  This is important for reproductive isolation in areas where different species share breeding areas.  Once a mate has been attracted, the pair begins amplexus in which the male frog grasps onto the female to initiate fertilization. The species is polygynous, with the male generally seeking to mate with as many females as it can attract. Eggs are attached to substrates such as emergent vegetation, and unlike other frog species, these egg masses are typically laid in permanent bodies of water rather than vernal pools.\n\nWhen male frogs aggregate, choruses will form and establish a cacophony of numerous unique advertisement calls. Consequently, male individuals experience intraspecific mating competition and often encounter immense pressure to produce unique call signals that are both attractive and audible to the limited number of available females. Such challenges are further complicated by the rapid fluctuation of males within a chorus, the potential risk of increased exposure to predators, and sexual selection of specific call signals through female choice.\n\nThese factors give rise to a social plasticity in the calling behavior of the American green tree frog. In order to maintain competition, male individuals will either modify their signal features, such as the temporal and spectral properties of calls or their signal timing, to reduce signal interference with other neighboring males. Temporal and spectral properties include call duration and call frequency. Changes in signal timing include initiation of advertisement calls during different times of the night. It has been found that male green tree frogs will more often alter their signal timing to attract females due to physiological constraints in the frog's call production mechanism and female choice against increased call duration and period in favor of precise call timing. Modifying signal behavior towards every frog within a chorus is extremely costly and inefficient. However, forcing male individuals to engage in selective attention of advertisement calls from only a few of their closest rivals.\n\nSome male American green tree frogs will not emit or alter their advertisement calls and instead choose to remain silent. Labeled as 'satellites', these frogs will wait to intercept the signals of nearby calling males and mate with approaching sexually active females through amplexus. Such sexual parasitism and call avoidance occur mainly to conserve the frog's energy and avoid predation during mate competition.\n\nAndrogens are used for energy during call signal production. As a satellite male green tree frog engages in non-calling mating behavior, androgen quantities are found to decrease to lower levels compared to calling behavior, suggesting a causal relationship between sex hormones and mate calling tactics.\n\nIn order to help decide whether to engage in satellite non-calling behavior, male green tree frogs will eavesdrop on other nearby male competitors and adjust their mating responses based on the qualities of their call signals. If given with the choice, females prefer large males with advertisement calls of lower frequencies. Other notable features include the latency to call and male focal size. When eavesdropping male competitors with low call frequencies, large male green tree frogs are found to reduce their latency to call and raise call rates. Small males in contrast will only reduce their latency to call in response to competitors with average call frequencies.\n\nAmerican green tree frogs are also able to undergo interspecific mating competition. In southern Florida, the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) is an invasive species that has a similar call to the American green tree frog with respect to timing and pitch. A study found that their calls compete acoustically with each other due to their similarity which limits communication space. In order to compete with the Cuban tree frog, American green tree frogs modified their calls to be shorter, louder, and more frequent so that potential mates would have a better chance of detecting the call.\n\nAs a tadpole, the American green tree frog is easily predated by sunfish, bass, and dragonflies, including both aeshnidae and libellulidae odonate naiads. The species is especially vulnerable to predation when living in temporary ponds compared to permanent waters. To combat predation, green tree frog tadpoles may increase hiding behavior while in water to avoid capture.\n\nThe American green tree frog is also prone to a few parasites, including nematodes, protozoans, and trematodes.\n\nContrary to most amphibians, the American green tree frog is not easily susceptible to the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) pathogen and the disease chytridiomycosis. Reasons explaining why are relatively unknown, but one study hypothesizes that variances in climate, frog immunity, and frog habitat are potential factors.\n\nWhen a male frog engages in vocalization either for aggression or mate attraction, androgen energy stores are used and become depleted. Interestingly, glucocorticoids, such as corticosterones, also appear to change during calling behavior. According to the Energetics-Hormone Vocalization model, glucocorticoid levels in males will rise as androgen levels decrease following vocalization. When observing hormonal levels in both calling and satellite non-calling males, reduced androgen levels and elevated glucocorticoid levels are found among satellite non-calling males compared to calling males. These observations suggest a possible mechanism dictating vocalization and the alternation between calling and non-calling behavior in the green tree frog. Further study is required however on the relationship between glucocorticoids and male vocalization to consider causality.\n\nThe causality of vocalization by androgens is also limited by the American green tree frog's social environment. According to one study, androgens themselves were not sufficient to initiate call signals in male frogs when in the presence of social stimuli such as other frog choruses. This suggests that androgens on their own may provide males with enough motivation to call, but they may also require additional social context to produce various call signals during situations such as mating.\n\nAmerican green tree frogs are popular pets because of their small size, appearance, and the undemanding conditions needed to take care of them. Unlike many amphibians, they do not require artificial heating unless household temperatures drop below 21 °C (70 °F). They need a large (at least ten-gallon) terrarium and do best with a substrate that will hold some humidity, such as commercial shredded bark or coconut husk bedding, or untreated topsoil on the floor of the terrarium. Tree frogs are arboreal, so the height of the tank is more important than the length. A variety of things for climbing, such as plants or branches, should be in the habitat. A shallow water dish should be included. Captive frogs should not be handled more than necessary; when necessary, clean gloves should be worn.\n\nThe American green tree frog became the state amphibian of Louisiana in 1997 and of Georgia in 2005.\n\nAmerican green tree frogs can also be used as bioindicators for aquatic contamination. Synthetic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls are found in many pesticides and pollute the green tree frog's aquatic habitats. Because the frog's skin is thin and permeable, synthetic compounds absorb easily upon contact, making the species a viable variable to measure contamination.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea), is one of two species of night heron in genus Nyctanassa. Unlike the black-crowned night heron, which has a worldwide distribution, the yellow-crowned is restricted to the Americas. It is known as the bihoreau violacé in French and the pedrete corona clara or yaboa común in some Spanish-speaking countries.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The yellow-crowned night heron was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He placed it with herons, cranes and egrets in the genus Ardea and coined the binomial name Ardea violacea. Linnaeus based his account on the \"crested bittern\" that had been described in 1729–1732 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in the first volume of his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands. Linnaeus specified the type locality as North America, but this has been restricted to the Carolinas following Catesby. The yellow-crowned night heron is now placed together with the extinct Bermuda night heron in the genus Nyctanassa that was introduced in 1887 by the Norwegian born zoologist Leonhard Stejneger. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek nux meaning \"night\" with anassa meaning \"queen\" or \"lady\"; the specific epithet is from Latin violaceus meaning \"violet-coloured\". The related heron, the Bermuda night heron, was endemic to Bermuda, but probably became extinct following human colonization.\n\nFive subspecies are recognised:\n\nBeing a heron, the yellow-crowned night heron is related to egrets and bitterns (the family Ardeidae), and, more distantly, to pelicans and ibises (the order Pelecaniformes). The night herons are usually considered to have separated from the day herons (such as the great blue heron or the green heron).\n\nVarious classifications recognize five subspecies, but little is known as to how much they are integrated together and how much their geographic range varies. Their body size decreases from north to south, and the shape of their bills varies geographically, depending on the size of the crustaceans they eat in different regions.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron is a rather stocky wading bird, ranging from 55 to 70 cm (1 ft 10 in – 2 ft 4 in) and from 650 to 850 g (1.43–1.87 lb), the females being a little smaller than the males. The yellow-crowned night heron has a wingspan ranging from 101 to 112 cm (3 ft 4 in – 3 ft 8 in). The neck, slim when extended, exposes its large head (compared to its body), with a large and heavy bill.\n\nThe body and back are a smooth grey-blue, with a black scaled pattern on the wings. The long legs are yellow and turn coral, pink or red during courtship. The most characteristic part of the yellow-crowned night heron is the head: black and glossy, with white cheeks and a pale yellow crown going from the bill, between the eyes and to the back of the head, giving the bird its common name. Such colours make the face appear striped in a horizontal black-white-black-white pattern. Long, thin, white feathers grow to the back of the crown during mating season. The bill, also black, is thick and deeply set under the eyes which are dark orange or red.\n\nLike all herons, the yellow-crowned night heron flies with long, slow purposeful wing beats. It can be found gliding over water with its legs easily visible, extended straight below the tail, unlike the black-crowned night heron, whose legs can barely be seen in flight.\n\nIt takes about three years for yellow-crowned night herons to acquire the full physical appearance of adults. Before that, the young birds show signs of immaturity such as a brownish body, an overall greyish head, drab colors and spots and streaks on their plumage.\n\nAlthough the adults are easy to tell apart, juvenile yellow-crowned night heron can look very similar to juvenile black-crowned night heron. Yellow-crowned juveniles tend to stand straighter and have heavier bills and longer legs, and their spots and streaks are finer than those of the black-crowned.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron looks for shallow water to live in: marshes, wooded swamps, and lakeshores for inland populations, and thickets, mangroves and cliff-bound coasts for coastal populations. It can also be found in areas that don't always have enough water, but that get flooded on a regular basis. Its habitat is closely linked to that of the crustaceans that make for most of its diet, and it tolerates fresh water, brackish water and saltwater.\n\nAnother important habitat factor is nesting sites. The yellow-crowned night heron needs bushes or trees to build nests, although it will use rock ledges where vegetation is unavailable (for example, on cliffs).\n\nUnlike the black-crowned night heron, the yellow-crowned does not mind living near humans and can be found in wooded neighborhoods, nesting on rooftops and driveways. Such cohabitation may not go smoothly and can create conflicts with humans.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron is found exclusively in the Americas, and its distribution depends closely on food (mainly crustaceans) availability.\n\nIt winters where the climate allows for year-round crab activity: tropical and subtropical regions, south Florida, the Gulf Coast (Louisiana to Alabama), and the eastern Texas coast. It is also found in Mexico, Central America, Galápagos Islands, the Caribbean and northern South America (south to Peru and Brazil in coastal regions) where generally resident.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1960, the yellow-crowned night heron spread northward for reasons still not clear. Today, in addition to its winter and year-round range, it can be found in the south-east inland of the United States during breeding season and additional isolated breeding colonies have been recorded even farther inland, all the way to the northern border of the United States.\n\nDifferent subspecies and populations have different migratory behaviour. Subspecies and populations that are insular or live in warmer areas are confirmed to be sedentary. The tropical subspecies and populations migrate, but to an extent that is still unclear for lack of data. The migratory behaviour of the yellow-crowned night heron has changed with its expansion north: one subspecies (Nyctanassa violacea violacea) migrates to the northern limits of its range, moving north and west after breeding. Birds observed outside of the normal range are usually first-years or strays.\n\nMigration occurs in mid-March in lower latitude, and from mid-March to April in higher latitude.\n\nThe most common call of the yellow-crowned night heron is a loud, sharp and quick squawk that the bird gives shortly after taking off or uses as an alarm call or an aggression call. The young beg for food with a soft chu-chu-chu call that becomes louder as the chicks grow older and more demanding. A different range of vocalizations plays an important part in courtship and pair formation. Males and females use a yup-yup call during the greeting ceremony, and a huh! call when they form a pair among other nesting birds. The male concludes his courtship display with a whoop which may or may not lead to the pair actually forming.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron eats mainly crustaceans (crabs and crayfish) as well as insects, some fish (eels and pipefish) or worms (leeches and other aquatic worms). Crabs preyed upon include fiddler crabs, marsh crabs, blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus, Callinectes similis and Cardisoma guanhumi) and green crabs. It can also feed on amphibians, molluscs (mussels and snails), lizards, snakes, small rodents and small birds. The geographic location of the heron is closely related to the prey it may find, and the size and shape of its bill allows it to hunt for prey of specific size.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron may forage any time of the day and night, although it prefers the night to feed the young. It becomes very aggressive if another individual approaches when foraging, but will tolerate a safe distance of about ten meters. It selects prey visually, either stalking it or standing and waiting for it to come within reach. When hunting crayfish, the heron stands at the entrance of the burrow, always facing the sun so its shadow is not cast over the entrance of the burrow, which would alert the crawfish. It can also choose an alternate pattern of walking slowly towards prey with its body bent and its head retracted, then standing and waiting before walking slowly again, sneaking up effectively on unsuspecting crabs. Sometimes it can be seen running in shallow water after a prey, but it will not follow one in deep water.\n\nOnce close enough, it lunges with its bill. Small prey are swallowed whole while larger prey (for example, a large crab), it will try to dismember in order to eat the body first and the legs last, or to jab it straight through the body. It will also carry crabs, molluscs or fish away from the water to prevent them from escaping.\n\nAny indigestible material, such as crab shells, is ejected in a pellet, and it is quite common to find shells and pellets scattered around foraging and nesting areas.\n\nLike many other aspects of its life, the yellow-crowned night heron's breeding season depends closely on the emergence of crabs in the spring; the crab cycle itself depends on temperatures. As such, the breeding season of the yellow-crowned night heron varies geographically, typically between March and May. In some tropical locations, it can breed all year.\n\nIt is still unclear exactly how, and for how long, the yellow-crowned night heron forms a mating pair. Some herons arrive at breeding grounds already in pairs, meaning they either found a mate during their migration to the breeding grounds, or they have been with this mate for some time. Others form their pair or renew it upon reaching the breeding grounds.\n\nThe breeding grounds are chosen near water and host loose, rather small colonies of reproducing herons, unlike those of most wading birds that welcome large colonies. Colonies often start small with only a pair nesting, then grow over the years and can last over 20 years.\n\nAbout 9–10 days after arriving at the breeding grounds, the pair builds a nest. The male usually chooses an emplacement and starts to build the nest for the female. Eventually, both birds decide where to build their nest, sometimes starting several nests before settling down. At first, the male brings material (twigs, branches and such) for the female to build the nest, then both perform both roles. Sometimes they will steal material from a nearby nest being built. They can be seen repairing their nest well into the breeding season. Trees and bushes are the preferred location for nests, the herons will usually build in high branches away from the trunk. A pair can use the same nest for years, enlarging it every season; the first nest is usually just large enough to hold the eggs. Nest-building is not the result of successful courtship, but rather an active part of the courtship.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron typically has one brood per year. It will try to replace a brood completely lost if it is not too late into the breeding season, but not a partially lost brood. The female lays two to six eggs, depending on the conditions, especially the temperature. The eggs are oval and smooth, with a pale green-blue color. Both parents start guarding the nest as soon as the first egg is laid, and they both incubate the clutch in turn.\n\n24–29 days later, the young hatch, vulnerable and entirely dependent on their parents. They look nothing like the adults with their white-grey short, soft feathers, their wide blue eye-ring and their yellow bill.\n\nDuring the first two weeks, both adults brood the young. After this period, they will only shelter the chicks from sun, rain or strong wind. Both parents feed the young, taking turns gathering food and guarding the nest. They regurgitate food in the center of the nest rather than feeding each chick individually. The young do not recognize their own parents and will adopt their begging-for-food behavior whenever any adult is around them; the adults, on the other hand, recognize their own chicks and are aggressive towards other offspring, driving them away and refusing to feed them.\n\nWhen the nest grows too tight for the chicks, they start venturing to its edges; they leave the nest 36–42 days after hatching. They cannot fly yet, so they walk around the nests and return daily to the colony to be fed, and they keep doing so for another three weeks. They start taking short flights by the sixth week, and are capable of sustained flight between their seventh and eleventh week. Once again, crab availability intervenes at this point: the more crabs are available to the young, the less often they come back to the roost and the less they rely on adults to be fed.\n\nThe immature birds will roost with the adults until the end of the breeding season, after which they disperse to unknown destinations. They will not be seen on the breeding grounds until they have acquired their adult plumage (two or three years later), and little is known about their ecology during this time. This mystery is actually a research priority about the yellow-crowned night heron.[citation needed]\n\nLike many other species of birds, the yellow-crowned night heron is an intermediate host and amplifier of the eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus (sleeping sickness). This common virus in the Southeast of the United States is lethal to horses and can be to humans as well. It is transmitted by mosquitoes: an infected mosquito will transmit the virus to a yellow-crowned night heron, which will be unaffected by it but will host it (the heron is known as a \"reservoir host\" for the virus) until another mosquito picks it up from the heron and transmits it to a horse or a human. Because of the long distances over which yellow-crowned night herons travel during migration, they can carry the virus over larger geographical areas, becoming amplifiers of EEE. However, EEE remains a rare disease of which the symptoms can be treated, and only a few cases are identified most years.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron has no real competition for food. The adults have virtually no predators, but the nests are vulnerable to other animals. Both the eggs and the young are an appealing meal to American crows and some mammals such as raccoons. Crows are also known to harass adult yellow-crowned night heron out of their nest, or displace the eggs in order to use the nest themselves. The importance of the impact of such predation varies geographically, Virginia being the state where it matters the most.[citation needed]\n\nHuman activities also constitute threats to the yellow-crowned night heron. In areas where the herons cohabit with people, they are often disturbed or shooed away from their nests if they get too close to human habitations. Loss of habitat is another major threat to the yellow-crowned night heron, with the wetlands they favor regressing continually. Additionally, in some part of the Americas such as Louisiana and the Bahamas, the meat of the yellow-crowned night heron is considered a delicacy, leading to illegal hunting of the fledgling.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron is generally not considered a threatened species, as the population size is very large, its range is wide and it has a stable trend. Its status with the IUCN is of Least Concern, meaning no conservation action is required across the species’ range. However, this status changes in some specific geographic locations, such as Indiana, where the yellow-crowned night heron is considered endangered, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kentucky where it is classified as Threatened, and Virginia, where it is classified as Special Concern.[citation needed] As such, some conservation measures are taken locally, but the conservation of the yellow-crowned night heron is usually simply included in broader projects, especially those that aim for wetland conservation.\n\nThe yellow-crowned night heron was introduced in the Bermudas in the end of the 1970s as a means of biological control against land crabs, which were considered a pest as were digging holes in the golf courses and the population went out of control after the closely related Bermuda night heron went extinct in the 1600s. As yellow-crowned night herons are opportunistic feeders, not specialist feeders like the Bermuda night heron which have since decimated native land crab populations and have been observed predating endemic and critically endangered Bermuda rock lizards.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2019, the yellow-crowned night heron was named the official bird of the City of Houston, Texas.",

In addition to consuming prey such as aphids, leaf beetles, hoppers, mites, mealybugs and termites, C. morio also consume fruits such as bananas and dragon fruits.",
      "sections":"Chelisoches morio have four instar stages before molting into adults. Females average about 140 eggs within one batch. The incubation period lasts about 5–7 days. Adult males live for about 60 days and adult females live for about 94 days. Once the eggs hatch into the first instar, the nymphs congregate by the mother. The female then takes one day to feed the newly hatched nymphs. Afterwards, the nymphs molt into their second instar, growing and becoming independent of the female. The third and fourth instars show an increase in activity and predatory behavior, with the fourth instar being capable of killing adult prey.\n\nFemale C. morio lay eggs in clusters, known as egg masses. The eggs are laid via an ovipositor in an irregularly shaped nest. The nests are about body length in size and are lined with soil and coir particles. The female digs out and builds the nest in moist substrates. After the eggs are laid, the females remains beside the egg cluster and protects, whisks, rearranges and maintains moisture of the eggs with her mouthparts until they hatch. By guarding the cluster, the female ensures the viability of the eggs. If the female is separated from the eggs immediately after laying, they become void and will not hatch.\n\nOnce the eggs hatch into the first instar, the nymphs aggregate next to their mother. For the next day, the mother feeds the nymphs and tends to them with her mouthparts. Before molting into their second instar, the nymphs stop feeding. The mother continues to protect them throughout the molting process (10–20 minutes). After the nymphs have finished molting to the second instar, they disperse and maternal care is concluded.\n\nCourtship is initiated by the male. He begins by tapping his antennae back and forth until he reaches the female. A receptive female then begins tapping her antennae back and forth before touching the male's antennae. If the female is not receptive, the male will pursue until the female is receptive, or the female will use her own cerci to repel the male.\n\nThe touching of a female's antennae to the male's is the receptive signal that cues the male to move to the side of the female and curve his abdomen. In this position, the male pushes his cerci beneath the subgenital plate of the female, and their genitalia come into contact. A pair of C. morio can mate 2-8 times and copulation can last from minutes to an hour. Additionally, a male can mate with up to 6 females, each of which will produce fertilized eggs.\n\nMating occurs several times throughout an adults lifetime, and can occur at any time of day. Multiple matings is beneficial to the female as it leads to higher brood counts and increases the proportion of viable eggs.\n\nChelisoches morio is a polyphagous group, meaning it has a wide range of prey. This feature makes C. morio a promising candidate for biological control, as it hunts and kills many agricultural pests. C. morio has shown a huge amount of predation on pests  during all larval stages. These pests include Tirathaba rufivena, Pseudococcidae, Aphididae, Chrysomelidae and many others. The high prey consumption rates have made C. morio a focus of many different studies, ranging from the volume of pest intake, to their life cycle, and even testing different rearing techniques to most effectively protect agricultural land.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni), also known as the northern two-toed sloth, is a species of sloth from Central and South America. It is a solitary, largely nocturnal and arboreal animal, found in mature and secondary rainforests and deciduous forests. The common name commemorates the German naturalist Karl Hoffmann.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Hoffmann's two-toed sloth is a heavily built animal with shaggy fur and slow, deliberate movements. The fore feet have only two toes, each ending with long, curved claws, although three clawed toes are on each of the hind feet. Other features that distinguish it from three-toed sloths, which may be found in the same geographic areas, include the longer snout, separate rather than partially fused toes of the forefeet, the absence of hair on the soles of the feet, and larger overall size. The wrist of the sloth has developed some specific traits due to their slow, yet acrobatic motions.  These evolved traits include diminution and distal migration of the pisiform bone, with a loss of contact with the ulna; reduction of the distal end of the ulna to a styloid process; and extremely reduced contact between the ulna and triquetral bone.\n\nHoffmann's two-toed sloth is, however, much easier to confuse with the related Linnaeus's two-toed sloth, which it closely resembles. The primary physical differences between the two species relate to subtle skeletal features; for example, Hoffmann's two-toed sloth has three foramina in the upper forward part of the interpterygoid space, rather than just two, and often – but not always – has fewer cervical vertebrae.\n\nAdults range from 54 to 72 cm (21 to 28 in) in head-body length, and weigh from 2.1 to 9 kg (4.6 to 19.8 lb). Although they do have stubby tails, just 1.5 to 3 cm (0.59 to 1.18 in) long, this is too short to be visible through the long fur. The claws are 5 to 6.5 cm (2.0 to 2.6 in) long. Females are larger on average than males, although with considerable overlap in size. Their fur is tan to light brown in colour, being lighter on the face, but usually has a greenish tinge because of the presence of algae living in the hairs.\n\nIts karyotype has 2n = 49–51 and FN = 61.\n\nHoffmann's two-toed sloth inhabits tropical forests from sea level to 3,300 m (10,800 ft) above sea level. It is found in the rainforest canopy in two separate regions of Central and South America, separated by the Andes. One population is found from eastern Honduras in the north to western Ecuador in the south, and the other in eastern Peru, western Brazil, and northern Bolivia. Based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences, a divergence date of about 7 million years between these populations has been suggested. Two-toed sloths live in the canopies in the forests of the tropical rainforests.  They usually tend to be relaxing in the branches of the trees that are intertwined within each other throughout the sheltering treetops.  Most of the two-toed sloths activity takes place hanging upside down but when it comes time for urination and defecation they make their way to the ground. These creatures also come to the ground when in need of a new tree to live upon or to discover a new food source.\n\nThe five recognised subspecies of C. hoffmanni are:\n\nTwo-toed sloths spend most of their time in trees, though they may travel on the ground to move to a new tree. A study of sloths on Barro Colorado Island indicated that the Hoffmann's two-toed sloths there were almost exclusively nocturnal, even though in other locations they are known to be active during day.  The authors attributed this in part to competition with the brown-throated sloth.  They often move slowly through the canopy for about eight hours each night, and spend much of the day sleeping in tangles of lianas. They move only very slowly, typically at around 0.14 m/s (0.46 ft/s), although they can move up to 50% faster when excited. They are solitary in the wild, and, aside from mothers with young, it is unusual for two to be found in a tree at the same time.\n\nThe name \"sloth\" means \"lazy\", but the slow movements of this animal are actually an adaptation for surviving on a low-energy diet of leaves. These sloths have half the metabolic rate of a typical mammal of the same size. Despite their low metabolic rates, two-toed sloths physiologically respond to hypoxia and hypercapnia similarly to other mammals with higher metabolic rates. Sloths have very poor eyesight and hearing, and rely almost entirely on their senses of touch and smell to find food.[citation needed]\n\nThis species often exhibits exaggerated wobbling of the head. Another trait of this sloth is it often spits when the mouth opens. The saliva often accumulates on the lower lip, giving the creature a comical appearance.[citation needed]\n\nTwo-toed sloths hang from tree branches, suspended by their huge, hook-like claws. The clinging behaviour is a reflex action, and sloths are found still hanging from trees after they die. The sloth spends almost its entire life, including eating, sleeping, mating, and giving birth, hanging upside down from tree branches. Usually, sloths are found right side up when they descend to the ground to defecate, which they usually do about once every three to eight days.  They will also ground themselves to urinate, change trees if they wish, or mate, as well as give birth.  While terrestrial locomotion is usually thought to involve the sloth lying on the ground and pulling themselves forward, they have actually been seen walking on their palms and soles.\n\nSloths descend about once every eight days to defecate on the ground. The reason and mechanism behind this behavior have long been debated among scientists. There are at least five hypotheses: 1) fertilize trees when feces are deposited at the base of the tree; 2) cover feces and avoid predation; 3) chemical communication between individuals; 4) pick up trace nutrients in their claws, that are then ingested and 5) favor a mutualistic relationship with populations of fur moths. More recently, a new hypothesis has emerged, which presents evidence against the previous ones and proposes that all current sloths are descendants from species that defecated on the ground, and there simply has not been enough selective pressure to abandon this behavior, since cases of predation during defecation are actually very rare.\n\nSloths have many predators, including the jaguars,  cougars, ocelots, harpy eagles, margays, and anacondas. If threatened, sloths can defend themselves by slashing out at a predator with their huge claws or biting with their canines. However, a sloth's main defense is to avoid being attacked in the first place. The two-toed sloth can survive wounds that would be fatal to another mammal its size. The sloth's slow, deliberate movements and algae-covered fur make them difficult for predators to spot from a distance. Their treetop homes are also out of reach for many larger predators.[citation needed]\n\nTheir long, coarse fur also protects them from sun and rain. Their fur, unlike other mammals, flows from belly to top, not top to belly, allowing rainwater to slide off the fur while the animal is hanging upside down.[citation needed]\n\nHoffmann's two-toed sloth inhabits a range of different trees within its habitat, although it seems to prefer those with plentiful lianas and direct sunlight. They have a typical home range of about 2 to 4 ha (4.9 to 9.9 acres), and may spend most of their lives travelling between just 25 or so trees.\n\nCourtship consists of the female licking the male's face and rubbing her genitals against the male's body. Gestation lasts between 355 and 377 days, and results in the birth of a single young.  The birth takes place on either the ground or in the hanging position. Newborn sloths weigh 340 to 454 g (12.0 to 16.0 oz), and are precocial, already possessing long claws and able to cling to their mothers' undersides. They begin to take solid food at 15 to 27 days, and are fully weaned by 9 weeks. Although relatively quiet as adults, young sloths make loud bleating alarm calls if separated from their mothers.\n\nIn captivity, the two-toed sloth was seen giving birth by hanging upside down and attempting to pull the infant between her hind limbs and onto her abdomen.  Other sloths were seen hanging under the mother and infant to protect the infant from falling.\n\nHoffmann's two-toed sloths reach sexual maturity at two to four years of age and have been reported to live up to 43 years in captivity.\n\nThough two-toed sloths also eat buds, tender twigs, young plant shoots, fruits and flowers, most of their diets consist of tree leaves. They use their lips to tear off their food and chew with their peg-like teeth which have no enamel and are always growing. Additionally, they have been observed using mineral licks, which can provide them with essential nutrients.\n\nDue to their low concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol, it is believed that two-toed sloths cannot synthesize vitamin D through skin contact with sunlight. They make up for this lack of synthesis through their diet.\n\nAlthough they are not true ruminants, sloths have three-chambered stomachs. The first two chambers hold symbiotic bacteria to help them digest the cellulose in their fibre-rich diets, while only the third chamber contains digestive glands typical of the stomachs of most other mammals. A sloth may take up to a month to completely digest a meal, and up to two-thirds of a sloth's weight may be the leaves in its digestive system.[citation needed]\n\nHabitat destruction is probably causing a decrease in the wild Hoffmann's two-toed sloth population, but little reliable data is available on the number of wild individuals. Sloths and people have little contact with one another in the wild.\n\nThe reproduction process of the two-toed sloths has some differences when compared to the three-toed sloths. Two toed sloths tend to mate all year around; they do not really go by a schedule. Typically, mating occurs during the rainy season and birth during the dry season. The female carries the baby for typically 11.5 months. Sloths do not tend to have one life long breeding partner. When the females are ready to mate, they let out a loud scream which attracts the males; if numerous males are ready to mate, they fight each other; after done mating, the male will usually leave. One factor that might explain this difference is that in some places, female sloths congregate around small, heterogeneously distributed habitats, allowing dominant males to gain mating access with multiple females with relatively little risk and effort. The female is the one who solely takes care of the baby sloth until they are independent and do not need the mother anymore. For the first 6–9 months of birth, mother sloth is carrying the baby and nurturing it until they are capable of being on their own. Sloths are sexually matured by the age 3 and are ready to start reproducing of their own.\n\nSloths are known to be heterothermic. Their body temperature ranges 86–93 °F (30–34 °C), which, compared to other mammals, is on the cold side. Having these low temperatures helps the sloths conserve their energy. Sloths' fur is grown specifically for a job which is to grow algae. The algae grow within their hair shaft and benefits the creatures' camouflaging techniques. The hair grows in a special system of being parted along the stomach and flows from belly to back; this is useful for when sloths are hanging upside down and the rainwater can run off.",

      "introduction":"\n\nMaladera castanea (Arrow, 1913)\n\nMaladera formosae, commonly known as the Asiatic garden beetle and formerly known as Maladera castanea, is a species of beetle in the family Scarabaeidae. It is native to Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea, and Russia but was introduced to North America in the 1920s where it is considered a pest of turfs, gardens, and crop fields. Adults are active in the summer during which they can be found feeding on leaves and flowers or gathering around light sources at night.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Adults range in length from 8-9mm and are reddish-brown in color with an iridescent sheen. Larvae, similarly to larvae of other species in the family Scarabaeidae, are referred to as white grubs. M. formosae grubs grow from approximately 1.4mm to 19mm in length as they feed on plant roots and decaying plant material.\n\nMaladera formosae are frequently mistaken for other species of scarab beetles. However, adults can be distinguished by their sturdy bodies, reddish-brown hue with an iridescent shine, concealed labrum, antenna with 10 segments, flat rear tibia featuring apical spurs separated by tarsal articulations, and elongated male genitalia with sizable, movable apical hooks.\n\nLarvae have C-shaped bodies, are predominantly white, and have brownish-orange white heads. M. formosae larvae can be distinguished from other white grub larvae by their prominent maxillary stipes, aggressive behavior, and unique chevron-shaped raster pattern underneath their Y-shaped anal slits.\n\nMaladera formosae is native to East Asia and was originally found in China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and eastern Russia. It has also become established in the United States as an invasive species. M. formosae was first discovered in North America in the United States, specifically in New Jersey in 1921. In its first decade in the United States, M. formosae spread throughout the East Coast. By 1933, M. formosae was recorded within 10 states and 1 district consisting of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. It then spread southward and westward, leading to it being found by 2009 in at least 11 additional states, including Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Vermont, and West Virginia with possible identification in Kansas and Missouri. The most recent state in which M. formosae was newly reported is Florida in 2012. M. formosae has also been identified in the two Canadian provinces of Quebec in 1996 and Nova Scotia in 2003. In total, M. formosae is now found in the United States in at least 24 states and Canada in 2 provinces.\n\nAdult beetles feed most actively during the night. Their diet consists predominantly of the foliage and flowers of various plants totaling over 100 different species. They also feed sparingly on blades of grass. Foliage consumption typically progresses inwards and, when beetles are abundant, only the midvein of the leaf will remains. This damage is often not attributed to M. formosae—their nighttime feeding means  they are rarely observed in the act.\n\nAdults prefer eating flowers like asters, chrysanthemums, dahlias, goldenrods, roses, strawflowers, sunflowers, and zinnias. Grubs act as pests for various ornamentals, turfs, and gardens along with field crops, such as sweet potatoes, soybeans, and corn. They typically feed on plant roots and decaying plant material. Field and laboratory experiments have been performed assessing adult beetle preference for different host plants. Field experiments found that basil was preferred compared to beet, carrot, eggplant, hot pepper, kohlrabi, parsnip, sweet pepper, and turnip. Laboratory experiments found that basil was preferred when compared to American sweetgum, arrowwood viburnum, elderberry, green ash, red maple, and sugar maple, but equally preferred when compared to beets and kohlrabi.\n\nMaladera formosae undergoes a similar life cycle to other white grub pests like Japanese beetles and masked chafers. It undergoes a complete metamorphosis with one generation each year, though the exact timing of its life stages depends on temperature and humidity. Research has, however, suggested that multiple generations can be produced each year, granted a sufficiently warm and moist environment is provided.\n\nAfter mating in July or August, females lay groups of eggs 1-10cm below the surface. They typically lay 3-15 groups of up to 20 eggs each with total egg counts averaging approximately 60 eggs, though as many as 178 eggs have been observed for a single female beetle. Females prefer ovipositing in moist, sandy soils that are near host plants or beneath shady plants. These preferred environments are usually well-irrigated, weedy patches of turf. Eggs absorb and swell from moisture in soil over time, which is consistent with other white grub species. Eggs hatch within 10 days with most larvae emerging in mid July.\n\nLarvae undergo three instars, growing from 1.4mm to 19mm. First-instar larvae feed on young roots and decaying plant material in shallower soil up to 13cm deep. Larvae molt to enter their second and third instars once they have eaten enough. They typically enter their third instar by September or mid October. Larvae then overwinter by burrowing and becoming dormant beneath the frost line, 15-30cm below the surface. Approximately one-quarter of larvae are slow to mature or late to hatch. Such larvae often do not reach their third instar before the arrival of winter. Some of these larvae can survive the winter in their second instars, but first-instar larvae typically fail to do so. In the following spring, surviving larvae will burrow closer to the surface and continue feeding 13cm deep or less in the soil.\n\nAfter approximately 10 months, third-instar larvae pupate in June or July by compacting soil 4-10cm underneath the surface. They enter their prepupal stage first, becoming inactive for 4 days before fully pupating. After 10 days, they emerge as adults in July but remain in their pupal skin for several more days as their exoskeletons harden.\n\nAdults usually live no more than a month but can live for up to 100 days. They are usually seen from the period ranging from late June to the end of October during which they feed, mate, and reproduce.\n\nFemales prefer specific host plants, soil moistures, and types of soil for ovipositioning. Specifically, moist, cool soil that is shaded by canopies is preferred. M. formosae is mainly found in regions with long grass, but it shows no preference for ovipositioning in short or long grass environments. However, females have demonstrated a preference for corn-soybean fields for oviposition. Moist environments can prevent the female's eggs from drying out. As a mechanism for pest control, modifying these variables can reduce oviposition to regulate the number of this species. Furthermore, studying the pheromones that this species possesses can be useful for controlling mating and oviposition rates to monitor species numbers.\n\nIn theory, the sex of individual beetles can be identified by females having more pronounced front tibia. However, this is difficult to identify in individual beetles given that they vary in size and no database for leg size measurements exists. Instead, sex determination for M. formosae can be quickly performed under a dissecting microscope or hand lens by assessing posterior abdominal sternite and pygidium orientation. The pygidiums of males pinch the edges of their sternites, while the pygidiums of females do not do so.\n\nMaladera formosae is typically considered a minor pest of turf and ornamentals. However, these beetles quickly become a major nuisance when they grow to be locally abundant: larval radicular feeding and adult foliar feeding cause major damage.\n\nMaladera formosae has become a problem for crop fields found throughout Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, for which it has been reported as being even more damaging than other white grub species. Many crop fields in these states undergo a crop rotation between mint, corn, and soybeans. It is believed by researchers that M. formosae populations persist throughout the entirety of these crop rotations, feeding on the crops themselves and causing significant damage. Researchers have estimated that M. formosae larvae cause a loss of $325 per acre of land for growers in these states.\n\nVarious root diseases and root-feeding insects have been found to harm perennial strawberry cultivation within the northeastern United States. The most important of these damaging factors are black root rot disease caused by Rhizoctonia fragariae and physical root damage caused by white grubs and root weevils. Alongside Anomala orientalis, M. formosae has been identified as being amongst the most common white grub pests of Connecticut strawberry fields. Research studies have shown that physical damage by M. formosae did not affect rates of root infection.\n\nCurrent pest control options for M. formosae are limited, relying primarily on insecticides that are either ineffective or unevaluated for M. formosae. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 has also enacted restrictions that ban many carbamate and organophosphate insecticides traditionally used for white grub control. Of such options, only carbaryl, a carbamate, and trichlorfon, an organophosphate, remain viable for use on turfgrass.\n\nImidacloprid, a neonicotinoid, and halofenozide, a molt-accelerating compound, have been proven to be effective in controlling white grub populations. They are, however, limited in only being able to target eggs and larvae, which are difficult to detect due to being subterranean. Researchers believe this conflict in effectiveness of insecticides leads to overtreatment and mistreatment of agricultural fields with minimal or nonexistent M. formosae presence. This has the potential to create negative implications, such as expensive financial losses, increased resistance development, and unintended environmental consequences.\n\nThough grubs typically cause the most damage by feeding on plant roots, M. formosae adults are still an agricultural concern as they can defoliate several rows of field crops every night and their dispersal determines the location of future larval populations. Grub populations are difficult to notice but respond to limited insecticides. Adult populations are easier to notice than grub populations but respond to even fewer pesticide options, presenting a separate though related problem when compared to that of grubs.\n\nEntomopathogenic nematodes have been identified by researchers as an effective biological control for other white grub species. However, their efficacy for M. formosae is still being studied as the beetle has been shown to be less susceptible to common nematode strains, such as Heterohabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema glaseri, when compared to other white grub species. Another isolated strain, Steinernema scarabaei, has as identified in research studies as a possible alternative to pesticides for M. formosae given its high pathogenicity for M. formosae.\n\nDue to grubs being subterranean and adults being nocturnal, M. formosae infestation can be difficult to recognize. Researchers have compared the effectiveness of various sampling techniques, such as using compact cutters, golf hole cup cutters, and wire-mesh bait stations to improve methods for quantification of M. formosae grub population density. They found that the golf hole cup cutters presented the best option, as it is more sensitive than the other methods.",

      "introduction":"\n\nAcomys lewisi\n\nThe golden spiny mouse (Acomys russatus) gets its name from the reddish-orange spiny fur that covers its body from head to tail. This coarse, inflexible fur is thought to protect it from predation. Aside from the golden fur that covers its head and upper parts, its flanks are yellow and its underside is pale. It has gray legs with pale feet and black soles. It is also described as having a small, but distinct white spot under each eye. It is often found in the wild missing a part or all of its tail because it is able to shed this as a defense mechanism. However, it is not known how this is done, how often it can occur, or under what conditions. It lives an average of three years in the wild. It is omnivorous and feeds on seeds, desert plants, snails, and insects. Living in desert regions, it is a xeric animal that obtains water from the plants that it eats and produces very concentrated urine in order to conserve water. A. russatus is naturally nocturnal, but adapts to being diurnal when it shares a habitat with A. cahirinus.",
      "sections":"The golden spiny mouse thrives in dry, hot deserts and is common in Egypt and much of the Middle East, including Jordan, Israel, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. It is limited to these areas because its metabolic rate is much slower than predicted for an animal of its size, so it is unable to maintain a viable body temperature in colder environments where the temperature falls below 18 °C and can live in temperatures as high as 42.5 °C. A. russatus does not have a thermal neutral zone, but shows lowest oxygen consumption at 30 °C. However, one population was found in the high summits of the mountains in southern Sinai where the temperature falls well below this threshold and there is often snow in the winter.\nA. russatus is also very good at conserving the little water it gets from its diet of insects and plants. It does this by producing extremely concentrated urine with urea content up to 4800 mM and chloride concentration up to 1500 mM. This means that it could survive drinking sea water, which is very rare in mammals.\n\nAcomys russatus is an opportunistic breeder that reaches sexual maturity at approximately 58 days of age. There is no mating season for spiny mice, but rather they continue to breed throughout the year. Each female has an average of 3.5 litters per year with about 34 days between litters. They are viviparous and each gestation period lasts 5–6 weeks and produces 1–5 offspring. Weaning of each litter takes two weeks. When rainfall decreases, the salt concentration in their food sources increases, which negatively impacts reproduction in both males and females.\n\nThe most frequently studied aspect of Acomys russatus is its apparent ability to switch from nocturnal to diurnal activity patterns. Specifically, it is naturally nocturnal, but will become diurnal when sharing a habitat with its congener, another spiny mouse species, Acomys cahirinus. Since the two species share food sources, competition does not allow for both of them to be active at the same time in the same habitat. Because of its tolerance for higher temperatures and significantly greater ability to conserve water by concentrating its urine, A. russatus is the species that is better suited to become day-active to eliminate this competition. When this occurs, there is a true switch in circadian rhythm that affects body systems such as metabolism and excretion. This new rhythm can furthermore adapt to seasonal changes in day length, as with any other diurnal species. \nHowever, it is clear that the species has not completely evolved to be diurnal. In a lab setting where no other species is present, Acomys russatus immediately adopts nocturnal activity patterns with no transient phase, suggesting that its diurnal behavior is only an adaptation that is made when necessary. Furthermore, it has been found that the Golden Spiny Mouse’s eyes have not evolved to fit a diurnal lifestyle, but rather match the normal pattern of a nocturnal animal. This finding, along with their preference to forage in areas of lower light, such as between and under boulders, further shows that, if not for environmental factors, golden spiny mice would be nocturnal animals.",

      "introduction":"\n\nStrix ulula Linnaeus, 1758\n\nThe northern hawk-owl or northern hawk owl (Surnia ulula) is a medium-sized true owl of the northern latitudes.  It is non-migratory and usually stays within its breeding range, though it sometimes irrupts southward. It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus Surnia of the family Strigidae, the \"typical\" owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the genus Ninox are also called \"hawk owls\".",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The northern hawk-owl was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Strix ulula. The owl is now the only species placed in the genus Surnia that was introduced in 1805 by André Duméril. The type species was designated by George Robert Gray in 1840  as the northern hawk-owl. The genus name is of unknown etymology and may simply have been invented by Duméril. The specific epithet ulula is Latin for a \"screech owl\".\n\nA molecular phylogenetic study  of the owls published in 2019 found that the northern hawk-owl is sister to a clade containing the pygmy owls in the genus Glaucidium.\n\nThree subspecies are recognised:\n\nMale northern hawk-owls are generally 36–42.5 cm (14.2–16.7 in) long and weigh about 300 g (11 oz). Females are slightly bigger with a length of 37.2–44.7 cm (14.6–17.6 in) and a mass of about 340 g (12 oz). Both male and female have similar wingspans of about 45 cm (18 in). The northern hawk-owl plumage is relatively dark brown with an off-white spotting pattern on all dorsal parts of the body with the exception of the back of the neck which boasts a black v-shaped pattern. The underbelly is generally white or off-white which continues to the toes with brown bands on the breast and stomach. It also has a long tail with brown banding. The northern hawk-owl has a smokey white face with a black border, a flat head, yellow eyes and a yellow curved beak.\n\nThe northern hawk-owl has been said to resemble a hawk in appearance and in behavior. In North America, its appearance in flight is often considered similar to a Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii). It has been suggested that this may be because the hawk-owl may partially fill an important diurnal niche similar to that of day hunters such as hawks.\n\nVarious calls are used by the different sexes in different situations. When attracting a mate the male usually lets out a rolled whistle of ulululululululul and a sound similar to tu-wita-wit, tiwita-tu-wita, wita, when perching at a potential nest site. The female's call is usually less constant and more shrill.\n\nWhen alerting to danger, the northern hawk-owl lets out a sound similar to rike, rike, rike, rike. It also releases a high-pitched scream followed by a yip when an intruder is near to the nest. To warn of impending dangers to a fledgling, the hawk-owl will let out a noise similar to ki ki kikikikiki. Calls can vary in length from 15 s to 2 min.\n\nThree subspecies exist across the northern Holarctic. The North American subspecies S. u. caparoch spans from eastern Alaska through Canada to Newfoundland and in some areas extends south into northern United States. The other two subspecies are found in northeastern Europe and Siberia: S. u. tianschanica breeds in Central Asia reaching Xinjiang (China); and S. u. ulula resides across Siberia reaching its most eastern range.\n\nOccasionally, S. u. caparoch can extend its territory as far south as northern Minnesota and many other states in the northern United States including more central states such as West Virginia, New York, and South Dakota. These southern forays into the northern United States are rare and generally occur during winter, or following an explosion in a population of prey. S. u.  ulula can occasionally be found in more southern areas such as Great Britain, southern Russia and Scandinavia, following explosions of prey.\n\nNorthern hawk-owls are unevenly distributed and highly variable throughout the boreal forest. They live mostly in open coniferous forests, or coniferous forests mixed with deciduous species such as larch, birch, poplar, and willow. They are found in muskegs, clearings, swamp valleys, meadows, or recently burnt areas, and generally avoid dense spruce-fir forests. Their winter habitat is usually the same as the breeding habitat.\n\nThe northern hawk-owl generally starts its mating rituals at the beginning of March. After calling and pairing is complete the northern hawk-owl will build a nest and start to lay eggs. On average the northern hawk-owl will lay 3–11 eggs per brood. The nest sites are usually the tops of hollow stumps of old dead spruce trees. These nesting sites are usually 2–10 m (6.6–32.8 ft) above ground for the North American S. u. caparoch and approximately 4–5 m (13–16 ft) above ground for the Eurasian S. u. ulala. The specific dates of egg appearance can be quite variable depending on locality. In central Canada eggs are usually laid from 30 March to 5 June. On Newfoundland the appearance of eggs occurs later, between 9 May and 11 June. In Finland, however, eggs can be found anywhere between 30 March to 23 June.\n\nFor the most part, the female northern hawk-owl does the incubating of the eggs, whilst the male forages for food. Once the chicks have hatched their roles shift drastically. At about two weeks into the chicks' lives, the female starts to leave the nest for long spans of time (5 hours or more). This span of time is presumably when the female hunts. The male, however, will guard the nest diligently until the chicks leave. When predators (usually other raptors) fly nearby, the male will sometimes chase them away from the nest if he feels it is necessary. Once the owlets have grown to a size which allows less parental supervision, they will leave the nest. This occurs on average after their 21st day, and can begin as early as mid-June. After this the female will provide most of the care. However, the male will remain close and will still feed his young on occasion.\nThe northern hawk-owl has also been known to nest on cliffsides. It has little fear of humans, and will attack if the young are approached too closely.\n\nThe northern hawk-owl feeds on a variety of prey, which can include small rodents to mammals more robust in size, and a variety of birds — a typical diet for many boreal owls. In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl is known to feed primarily on voles from the Microtus family. These voles usually follow a 3–4 year cycle of abundance. Therefore, S. u. ulula numbers are affected negatively when the numbers of voles are lowest. In North America the subspecies S. u. caparoch also feeds upon microtine voles, but its population is primarily based on the ten-year cycling of the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl's biomass consists of about 94% microtine voles, whereas in North America the percentage of biomass contributed by voles can be as low as 20%. Juvenile hares are considerably more important at 40–50%.\n\nOther animals that are important prey items for the northern hawk-owl include the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) which has been documented to contribute as much as 20% to the hawk-owl's biomass. A long list of others includes mice, rats, voles, lemmings, cottontails, shrews, moles, the short-tail weasel (Mustela erminea), partridge, spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), doves, pileated woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus), sparrows, jays, robins, starlings, buntings, grackles, and finches. Frogs and even fish are sometimes taken. In the winter, feeding strategies change: where in summer the main source of food is mammals, in the winter a bigger portion of the hawk-owl's biomass consists of ground-dwelling birds, such as the ptarmigan and the grouse.\n\nThe northern hawk-owl is a partially diurnal hunter, although it has been recorded hunting at varying times and does not appear to have a preferred hunting time. Whether the bird resides in Eurasia or North America, the strategy is usually similar. The northern hawk-owl will perch and scour the immediate area for prey. As these owls are considered a search-oriented species, they likely do not stay put for long if the site is not producing prey. The hawk-owl prefers open, forest-type environments when perching. These environments include sphagnum bogs and partially deforested areas. The preferred perching tree of the northern hawk-owl is the spruce tree. When the hawk-owl attacks, it goes from a horizontal posture into a gliding dive. If the prey is further away, the bird will flap its wings a few times during the dive to increase distance. The hawk-owl has exceptional hearing and can plunge into snow to capture rodents below the surface.\n\nThe type of prey the hawk-owl catches will determine its eating strategy. For mammalian prey the ritual is generally the same: the northern hawk-owl will eviscerate its prey, eat the head first (especially for prey like the red squirrel, whose head is fairly large), and then — when tackling larger prey — it will eat the organs and cache the remains; with smaller prey, the owl will simply swallow the body whole.\n\nDue to its low density occurrence, sporadic fluctuations, and remote breeding locations, the northern hawk-owl is one of the least studied and poorly understood birds in North America. As a result, it is almost impossible to properly estimate its numbers.\n\nIn Yukon, northern hawk-owl densities were estimated to be between zero and six pairs per 100 km2 (39 sq mi). Despite these low densities, the North American population is thought to be fairly large given that they occur throughout the boreal forest. Duncan and Harris (1997) estimated that this population contains between 10,000 and 50,000 pairs.\n\nPopulations are known to fluctuate with cycles of small rodents  and irruptions are known to occur in sub-boreal regions throughout the world. In Scandinavia, populations have been reported to vary from a few hundred birds in certain years to over 4000 birds in others and even up to 10,000 breeding pairs in optimal years. Irruptions can be used as indicators of small mammal abundance  and in eastern North America, southern irruptions have been linked with low densities of red-backed voles in the high boreal forest.\n\nIn North America, over 50% of the northern hawk-owls' breeding territory occurs in non-commercial boreal forests  and as long as nothing threatens their northern habitats, no known factors challenge their existence. However, it is unknown what effects modern forestry would have on population levels because although it would decrease nesting localities, it would simultaneously create ideal habitat for Microtus prey. Fire suppression by humans is believed to negatively affect northern hawk-owl populations by reducing open areas for hunting and dead wood to nest in.\n\nThe status and conservation of this species is uncertain. A report by the Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC) recommended that no designation be assigned for the northern hawk-owl. Compared to the nineteenth century, southern irruptions in the New and Old World appear to have declined. Also, North American populations seem to be declining, although no proper documentation exists to confirm this trend. In Canada, it was ranked 85th overall to set conservation, research, or monitoring priorities. Downes et al. (2000) considered the hawk-owl to be of medium concern, but with a high priority to improve monitoring.\n\nThe northern hawk-owl is considered a falconry bird in Ontario, and may be used to hunt small game with a proper license.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe aardwolf (Proteles cristatus) is an insectivorous hyaenid species, native to East and Southern Africa. Its name means \"earth-wolf\" in Afrikaans and Dutch. It is also called the maanhaar-jackal (Afrikaans for \"mane-jackal\"), termite-eating hyena and civet hyena, based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland, a characteristic shared with the African civet.\n\nUnlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals. It eats insects and their larvae, mainly termites; one aardwolf can lap up as many as 300,000 termites during a single night using its long, sticky tongue. The aardwolf's tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites.\n\nThe aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern Africa – open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. It is nocturnal, resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The aardwolf is generally classified as part of the hyena family Hyaenidae. However, it was formerly placed in its own family Protelidae.[nb 1] Early on, scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena, which subsequently led to the creation of Protelidae. Recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably diverged from other hyaenids early on; how early is still unclear, as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 million years.[nb 2]\n\nThe aardwolf is the only surviving species in the subfamily Protelinae. There is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic, or can be divided into subspecies. A 2021 study found the genetic differences in eastern and southern aardwolves may be pronounced enough to categorize them as species.\n\nA 2006 molecular analysis indicates it is phylogenetically the most basal of the four extant hyaenidae species.\n\nProteles cristatus (aardwolf)\n\nCrocuta crocuta (spotted hyena)\n\nHyaena hyaena (striped hyena)\n\nParahyaena brunnea (brown hyena)\n\nThe generic name proteles comes from two words both of Greek origin, protos and teleos which combined means \"complete in front\" based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear. The specific name, cristatus, comes from Latin and means \"provided with a comb\", relating to their mane.\n\nThe aardwolf resembles a much smaller and thinner striped hyena, with a more slender muzzle, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back. It also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore and hindquarters and several stripes on its legs. The mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have. Its lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip.\n\nThe aardwolf is about 55 to 80 cm (22 to 31 in) long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about 20–30 cm (7.9–11.8 in) long, and stands about 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 in) tall at the shoulders. An adult aardwolf weighs approximately 7–10 kg (15–22 lb), sometimes reaching 15 kg (33 lb). The aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about 10 kg (22 lb)) than the eastern version (around 14 kg (31 lb)). This makes the aardwolf the smallest extant member of the Hyaenidae family. The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena. The skull is similar in shape to those of other hyenas, though much smaller, and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. It still has canines, but unlike other hyenas, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense. Its ears, which are large, are very similar to those of the striped hyena.\n\nAs an aardwolf ages, it will typically lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats.\n\nAardwolves live in open, dry plains and bushland, avoiding mountainous areas. Due to their specific food requirements, they are found only in regions where termites of the family Hodotermitidae occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs, including farmland. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.\n\nThere are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests.\n\nAn adult pair, along with their most-recent offspring, occupies a territory of 1–4 km2 (0.39–1.54 sq mi).\n\nAardwolves are shy and nocturnal, sleeping in burrows by day. They will, on occasion during the winter, become diurnal feeders. This happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat.\n\nThey are primarily solitary animals, though during mating season they form monogamous pairs which occupy a territory with their young. If their territory is infringed upon by another aardwolf, they will chase the intruder away for up to 400 m (1,300 ft) or to the border. If the intruder is caught, which rarely happens, a fight will occur, which is accompanied by soft clucking, hoarse barking, and a type of roar. The majority of incursions occur during mating season, when they can occur once or twice per week. When food is scarce, the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a single territory.\n\nThe territory is marked by both sexes, as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in 5-millimetre (0.20 in)-long streaks. Aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad. They often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so. If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every 50 m (160 ft). At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour, and upwards of 200 per night.\n\nAn aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens, and numerous feces middens, within their territory. When they deposit excreta at their middens, they dig a small hole and cover it with sand. Their dens are usually abandoned aardvark, springhare, or porcupine dens, or on occasion they are crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by springhares. They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every six months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night and sleep underground during the heat of the day.\n\nAardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators. Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks. If confronted, it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing. It also emits a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands.\n\nThe aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on Trinervitermes. This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf's range. In East Africa, they eat Trinervitermes bettonianus, in central Africa, they eat Trinervitermes rhodesiensis, and in southern Africa, they eat T. trinervoides. Their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark, which digs into the mound. They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites. An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 termites per night using its long, broad, sticky tongue.\n\nThey do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months. During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced. During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out Hodotermes mossambicus, a type of harvester termite active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter. The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera Odontotermes and Macrotermes. They are also known to feed on other insects and larvae, and, some sources mention, occasionally eggs, small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet. They use their wide tongues to lap surface foraging termites off of the ground and consume large quantities of sand in the process, which aids in digestion in the absence of teeth to break down their food.\n\nUnlike other hyenas, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals. Contrary to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and beetles. Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them. The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups, but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers, necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, Trinervitermes, forages in small but dense patches of 25–100 cm (9.8–39.4 in). While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about 1 km (0.62 mi) per hour, which translates to 8–12 km (5.0–7.5 mi) per summer night and 3–8 km (1.9–5.0 mi) per winter night.\n\nThe breeding season varies depending on location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July. During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves, which can result in conflict between rival males. Dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories. As the female comes into oestrus, they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own. Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding \"his\" cubs with her. Copulation lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours.\n\nGestation lasts between 89 and 92 days, producing two to five cubs (most often two or three) during the rainy season (October–December), when termites are more active. They are born with their eyes open, but initially are helpless, and weigh around 200–350 g (7.1–12.3 oz). The first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents. The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food. After three months, they begin supervised foraging, and by four months are normally independent, though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season. By the time the next set of cubs is born, the older cubs have moved on. Aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and a half to two years of age.\n\nThe aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and is relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if food is abundant. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as least concern. In some areas, they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock; however, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental. In other areas, the farmers have recognized this, but they are still killed, on occasion, for their fur. Dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf.\n\nFrankfurt Zoo in Germany was home to the oldest recorded aardwolf in captivity at 18 years and 11 months.",

      "introduction":"\n\nBactrocera tryoni, the Queensland fruit fly, is a species of fly in the family Tephritidae in the insect order Diptera. B. tryoni is native to subtropical coastal Queensland and northern New South Wales. They are active during the day, but mate at night. B. tryoni lay their eggs in fruit. The larvae then hatch and proceed to consume the fruit, causing the fruit to decay and drop prematurely. B. tryoni are responsible for an estimated $28.5 million a year in damage to Australian crops and are the most costly horticultural pest in Australia. Up to 100% of exposed fruit can be destroyed due to an infestation of this fly species. Previously, pesticides were used to eliminate B. tryoni from damaging crops. However, these chemicals are now banned. Thus, experts devoted to B. tryoni control have transitioned to studying this pests' behaviors to determine a new method of elimination.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Adult B. tryoni flies are reddish brown in color, have distinct yellow markings and are typically 5–8 mm in length. Adults hold their wings horizontally when walking and flick them in a specific, characteristic manner. The wingspan of B. tryoni ranges from 4.8 to 6.3 mm. B. tryoni may be mistaken for wasps as they appear wasp-like.\n\nThey are part of a species complex, or a group of morphologically similar but biologically distinct species. These are called sibling species. B. tryoni has three sibling species: B. neohumeralis, B. aquilonis, and B. melas. All of these flies are sympatric, meaning that they inhabit the same territory, except B. aquilonas, which inhabits a different geographical area in northwest Australia. Genetic data has suggested that B. aquilonas is simply an allopatric population of B. tryoni. Additionally, B. tryoni mate at night, while B. neohumeralis mate during the day. More pertinently, B. neohumeralis are not pests; they do not destroy crops. Despite this behavioral difference, B. neohumeralis and B. tryoni are nearly genetically identical: the two species are only differentiable based on newly developed microsatellite technology. The evolutionary relationship between the species within the B. tryoni complex is unknown.\n\nB. tryoni prefer humid and warm climates. Thus, they are most widespread in eastern Australia, as well as New Caledonia, French Polynesia, the Pitcairn Islands, and the Cook Islands. Commercial fruit production has increased in Australia, increasing the geographical area in which B. tryoni can reside, extending as far inland as central Queensland and New South Wales. Occasionally, there are outbreaks of B. tryoni in southern and western Australia; however, the coastal areas of Australia are relatively isolated from one another due to harsh, dry weather conditions in intervening regions that are unsuitable for B. tryoni. Therefore, other regions of Australia typically remain free of this pest as long as infested fruit is not transported between regions.\n\nAfter passing through a two-week pre-oviposition stage following emergence from the pupae, adult females deposit around seven eggs in a fruit puncture, and may deposit up to 100 eggs per day. Fruit punctures are holes in the skin of the fruit that allow the females to access the nutrient-rich interior. Females often oviposit in punctures made by other fruit flies, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), which results in many eggs occurring in a single cavity. Additionally, B. tryoni females can create their own puncture to oviposit in the fruit, called a \"sting\".\n\nEggs hatch into white larvae in 2–4 days under favorable weather conditions. These larvae, or maggots, eat toward the center of the fruit with their cutting jaws, causing it to rot. The maggots may reach up to 9 mm in length; larval development is completed in 10-31 days. At this point, the fruit has likely fallen to the ground. Up to 40 larvae can be reared from a single piece of fruit.\n\nThe maggot chews its way out of the remaining fruit and enters the soil, where it enters the pupal stage of development. Pupal development requires various temperature ranges from one week in warmer weather to one month in cooler conditions. The flexible amount of time needed for pupal development has resulted in B. tryoni relative adaptiveness to different environments.\n\nAfter the pupal stage is complete, adults emerge from the soil. This typically occurs near the end of the summer season. Unlike other fly pests, B. tryoni does not breed continuously, but spends the winter in the adult stage.  Adult females live many months, and up to four or five overlapping generations may occur annually.  Adults may live for a year or longer.\n\nB. tryoni have been found to infect almost all commercial fruit crops as hosts, including abiu, apple, avocado, babaco, capsicum, carambola, casimiroa, cherry, citrus, custard apple, granadilla, grape, guava, kiwifruit, mango, nectarine, papaya, passionfruit, peach, pear, persimmon, plum, pomegranate, prune, quince, loquat, santol, sapodilla, tamarillo, tomato, and wax jambu, with the exception of pineapples. B. tryoni strongly prefer to oviposit into rotting fruit, although some evidence suggests that they will oviposit into under-ripe fruit as well. B. tryoni prefer to select fruits that have an outer layer that is able to be punctured or has already been lesioned. The majority of research on B. tryoni host selection has included just a few, economically important crops.\n\nLarvae feed only on the flesh of fruit until they mature into adulthood. Adult flies, however, rely on leaf surface bacteria as a major source of protein. There is some evidence suggesting that the bacteria and flies co-evolved, but other data suggest that this symbiosis does not occur as the presence of protein-providing bacteria is not consistent throughout B. tryoni populations. Due to this dependence on protein originating from bacteria, it is possible to control the population by providing flies with artificial protein mixed with insecticide.\n\nB. tryoni flies mate at dusk. This is pertinent to control efforts because it is one of the few characteristics that distinguish it from sister species, B. neohumeralis, which are not a highly destructive species, even though the two are very closely related genetically and evolutionarily.\n\nB. tryoni males exhibit behavior termed cue-lure, meaning that they are strongly attracted to a specific scent. While this scent is artificially made, it is closely related to compounds occurring in nature. Male B. tryoni respond most greatly to the lure in the morning, likely because this is their peak of foraging time; however, an evolutionary reason for the cue-lure is not fully known. Cue-lure is only exhibited in sexually mature males, indicating that mate finding is related to the cue-lure behavior. However, other Bactrocera species have been identified as means of enhancing male competitiveness, or to afford protection from predation.\n\nB. tryoni lay their eggs in fruit. Females prefer to lay their eggs in fruit that is sweet, juicy, and not acidic. The presence of other female flies in pre- or post- oviposition on a piece of fruit was found to have no bearing on another female's likeliness to land on the fruit; however, female flies were more likely to bore into a piece of fruit that other female flies were currently ovipositing into, therefore increasing the density of larvae within a single piece of fruit. This is an example of reciprocal altruism as larvae are at an advantage at higher densities.\n\nB. tryoni have evolved to disperse widely, which was greatly influenced their ability to cause damage to farms. When fruit is available, the flies often do not disperse far distances (only a few hundred meters to a kilometer), but they have been found to travel large distances in the absence of fruit. In addition to lack of resources, adult flies may also move to locate overwintering sites or avoid dry or cold weather.\n\nThe genome of B. tryoni has been sequenced and published by a group at the University of New South Wales, Australia.  While the coding regions are mostly completely sequenced, about one-third of the genome appears to consist of highly repetitive sequences.\n\nB. tryoni has been the subject of extensive control regimens. One of these regimens is a Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone (FFEZ), where transporting fruit into certain regions of Australia and Polynesia is illegal. In May 2012, January 2013, February 2015, and February 2019, the fly was found in Auckland, posing a risk to horticulture and leading to a quarantine (see Biosecurity in New Zealand).\n\nFarmers in effected regions are encouraged to use a lure and kill tactic to combat the presence of B. tryoni. Lure and kill tactics include the use of some sort of bait that attracts the pest, or a lure. This can include semiochemical lures such as pheromones, food attractants, host mimics, or color attractants. The killing mechanism often involves pesticides, liquid traps in which the pest drowns, or sticky traps that the pest cannot escape from. At low densities of B. tryoni, lure and kill tactics are most effective as a mechanism to monitor the frequency of B. tryoni; at high densities, they effectively combat the pest via population reduction. Two of the most common lure and kill approaches for B. tryoni are the male annihilation technique (MAT) and the protein-bait spray (PBS).\n\nBoth male and female B. tryoni require proteins produced by bacteria found on the leaves of plants in order to reach sexual maturity. The protein-bait spray takes advantage of this behavior by combining necessary proteins normally acquired from leaf bacteria with deadly insecticides. The combination of protein and insecticide attracts B. tryoni of both sexes, resulting in elimination of adult flies. Neither the effectiveness of this technique, nor the scientific underpinnings of what protein exactly attracts B. tryoni to the spray, are well investigated.\n\nB. tryoni sexually mature males are strongly responsive to specific scents that may be associated with mating, or a cue-lure. A specific cue-lure, Willson's lure, was found to be incredibly effective at attracting sexually mature B. tryoni males. When combined with insecticides, artificially developed cue lures may be an effective elimination method of sexually mature males. While extensive research has suggested this is an effective strategy in other fly species, very few controlled experiments have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of the male annihilation technique in B. tryoni.\n\nControl efforts include submerging post-harvest fruit and treating fields of fruit trees with the chemicals dimethoate and fenthion. As of October 2011, the use of these chemicals was under review by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. As a result, dimethoate was suspended from use. As of 2014, fenthion was no longer commercially available in Australia.\n\nContainment efforts have included irradiating pupae in order to induce sterility. A study testing the viability of this technique found that sterility was dose independent, meaning that a single ionizing event was enough to render the male sperm sterile. Additionally, it was found that emergence and flight ability remained unaffected by the ionizing event. This indicates that males sterilized via a low dosage of radiation were equally as competitive as males that were not irradiated.\n\nA popular method for controlling populations of invasive or destructive species of flies involves producing a strain of fly that is incapable of reproducing. If this can be accomplished, this strain can be mass-produced and released into the wild without necessitating repeated exposure to irradiation as required in methods such as the sterile insect technique (SIT).If they have the same sexual competitiveness as wild type males, then the species' overall population will presumably decrease. In order to accomplish developing such a strain in B. tryoni, molecular tools capable of genetically transforming B. tryoni must be implemented. One such strain of a genetically compatible fly has been developed in Drosophila melanogaster. The phenotypic marker for the presence of an efficient vector for gene transfer is white eye color. Development of a genetically engineered B. tryoni strain that is compatible with gene transfer was successful; however, scientists have yet to develop a sterile strain that can be released into the wild.\n\nWhile this species is native to northeastern Australia, rising temperatures due to climate change has allowed the species to spread to other regions of Australia and Polynesia. B. tryoni are able to tolerate extremely high temperatures but have a minimum necessary temperature to breed; therefore, global warming has fostered their spread across Australia and Polynesia. Although B. tryoni have a minimum temperature requirement for survival, extreme plasticity and adaptation has been observed in adult B. tryoni. This adaptation has allowed them to survive in cooler temperatures and at higher altitudes. This behavior, combined with global warming, indicates that damage due to these insects will continue to increase as the temperatures continue to rise. One study predicted that farm damage due to Queensland fruit flies will increase by $3.1, $4.7, and $12.0 million with temperature increases of 0.5, 1 and 2 °C, respectively.\n\nRising CO2 levels may influence the distribution of B. tryoni. Based upon recent studies which utilize computer programs to simulate B. tryoni distribution in the event of rising temperatures, it was predicted that there will be an overall increase in Queensland fruit fly damage, but the fruit flies will re-localize to more southerly locations as northern and central Queensland will begin to exceed the maximum habitable temperature of B. tryoni. However, these simulations may not accurately predict the future distributions of B. tryoni as they have exhibited an immense capability to adapt to various conditions. The prediction is also complicated by the uncertainty of how the relative humidity will change in regions across Australia as temperature increases, and B. tryoni survival is heavily dependent upon a humid climate.",

The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis has a display with such a device and a black ghost knifefish.\n\nThe black ghost knifefish is a weakly electric fish as a result of the electromotor and electrosensory systems it possesses. While some fish can only receive electric signals, the black ghost knifefish can both produce and sense the electrical impulses. Electrogenesis occurs when a specialized electric organ found in the tail of the fish generates electrical signals, which are thus called electric organ discharges (EODs). Then, for these EODs to be sensed by the fish, electroreception occurs when groups of sensory cells embedded in the skin, known as electroreceptor organs, detect the electrical change. The EODs are used for two major purposes: electrolocation and communication.\n\nThe kind of EOD produced can be used to distinguish between two types of weakly electric fish: the pulse-type and the wave-type. The black ghost knifefish are considered to be the latter type, because they can continuously generate EODs in small intervals. Wave-type EODs have a narrow power spectra, and can be heard as a tonal sound, where the discharge rate establishes the fundamental frequency. By emitting its own continuous sinusoidal train of EODs, the fish can determine the presence of nearby objects by sensing perturbations in timing and amplitude of electric fields, an ability known as active electrolocation. The particular organs used to sense the self-generated high-frequency EODs are tuberous electroreceptor organs. On the other hand, when low-frequency electric fields are generated by external sources instead of the fish itself, a different class of electroreceptor organs is used for this passive electrolocation, called ampullary organs. Therefore, the black ghost knifefish uses an active and a passive electrosystem, each with its own corresponding receptor organs. The fish can also use a mechanosensory lateral line system, which detects water disturbances created by the motion of the fish's body. As nocturnal hunters, the fish can rely on all three systems to navigate through dark environments and detect their prey.\n\nEach species has a characteristic EOD baseline frequency range, which varies with sex and age within the species, as well. The baseline frequency is maintained to be almost constant at stable temperature, but will usually be changed due to the presence of others of the same species. Such changes in frequency relevant to social interaction are called frequency modulations (FMs). The role these FMs have in communication is significant, as black ghost knifefish have developed jamming avoidance responses, which are behavioral responses that avoid the overlapping of EOD frequencies between conspecific individuals to prevent sensory confusion. Moreover, a study was conducted that focused on sexual dimorphism in electrocommunication signals. Female black ghost knifefish generate EODs at a higher frequency than the males, an FM which can be used for gender recognition. A study found the subordinate black ghost knifefish exhibited noticeable gradual frequency rises (GFRs) in their EODs whereas the dominant fish did not, supporting the researchers' hypothesis that GFRs during communication are indicative of submissive signals.",

      "introduction":"\n\nCadra figulilella, the raisin moth, is a moth of the family Pyralidae. The raisin moth is known most commonly as a pest that feeds on dried fruits, such as the raisin and date.  It covers a range that includes much of the world, primarily situating itself in areas of California, Florida, the Eastern Mediterranean region, and some parts of Africa, Australia, and South America.  The moth prefers to live in a hot, arid climate with little moisture and plentiful harvest for its larvae to feed on.  Study of this species is important due to the vast amount of economic damage it causes yearly and worldwide to agriculture crops.\n\nAdult raisin moths have a life span of 11–16 days and devote most of their resources to reproduction. Eggs are laid on or near the fruit and larvae immediately begin boring and infesting the fruit. Fumigation after harvest does not save infested fruits, as the pest has already dug into the fruit and spoiled it.\n\nThe mating process consists of pheromone release by both the male and female moths as well as many other copulatory rituals that function to prevent interspecies mating.  Copulation consists of specific head bump technique paired with thrusting behavior. There is also a specific method of curling the abdomen that distinguishes this moth from the moths of other species.\n\nThis moth also displays migration behavior as well as nocturnal activity. During the start of cold winter months, the larvae of the raisin moth will move from the fruit in which they are enveloped to the top 4 inches of topsoil. It tends to be most active after 7pm, or around sundown, and then ceases activity by 5am, or before sunrise.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The adults of this moth species are about 1 cm long and have a brown grey complexion. Their wingspan ranges from 14–16 mm. A key element of distinction are its hindwings, which have short fringes. Reproductive structures also serve as an element of differentiation. This moth has an almost straight uncus and a long thin costal outgrowth and at almost 90° angle. Wing pattern does not serve as a differentiating element in this species as it is very similar to other species of its genus. Their body has six rows of purple-colored dots running horizontally and their head is a reddish-brown color.\n\nEggs are small, round, and slightly yellow-orange and creamy white in color. They tend to turn to a more subtle greenish-grey color as they mature.\n\nThe raisin moth likely got its name due to being first identified on Muscat raisins in Fresno County, California in 1928. Its population quickly increased and spread throughout the world, now claiming ubiquity in the Eastern Mediterranean region, California, Florida, and some parts of Australia, South America, and Africa. Specifically, the moth is present in regions of optimal breeding temperature and food resources. Since its rise, it first spread to the tropics and later nudged its way into cooler areas by following humans on trade routes.\n\nAdult moths will not stay in a region that is below 15 °C or above 36 °C, which are the thresholds for their temperature tolerance. Adults will not fly at a temperature below 13 °C. The raisin moth prefers a climate that has arid, hot, clear, and rainless summers, along with mild winters.\n\nThe raisin moth is a polyphagous insect, meaning that it feeds on a large variety of different fruits. The larvae in particular are herbivorous and prefer to feed on dry fruits on the ground or still on the plant. In particular they feed on fallen figs, ripe carob pods, grapes, cottonseed cake, cacao beans, prunes, peaches, apricots, pears, and more. In the springtime, they primarily feed on fallen mulberries because other host fruits are often scarce. However, they can be found year-round in decaying date fruit.\n\nDuring this stage of the moth's life cycle, the moth will mainly consume water.  They do not focus much on foraging and instead devote full resources to reproduction. This is possibly due to the very short duration of this stage.\n\nDevelopment of one generation lasts 43 days at an optimal temperature of 28 °C.\n\nThe female raisin moth lays her fertilized eggs directly on or near the surface of the fruit of the host plant. The eggs are sticky, but are not glued down. They are laid one by one, or in small batches, and often in a star-shape. After oviposition, eggs hatch within 4 days, and approximately 75% of laid eggs will hatch successfully. Eggs are small, round, and slightly yellow-orange and creamy white in color. They tend to turn to a more subtle greenish-grey color as they mature.\n\nUpon hatching, neonatal larvae, or caterpillars, immediately begin digging into all parts of fruit. Larvae develop continuously throughout the year, living within fruits on the trees or rotting on the ground. Larval development depends on warmth, so development takes longer during winter periods. During cold winter periods, the larvae will stay in topsoil or under the loose bark of host plants and exhibit diapause, or a period of suspended development, until warmer temperatures arise.\n\nPupa is the term for the moth in its cocoon phase. Pupae are web-covered and brown. The cocoon is silken and they are usually hidden on the trees or in the upper soil layers near the vine trunks. Pupal development period usually lasts about 10 days, after which the adult moth emerges from the cocoon.\n\nMale and female moths live on average 11 and 16 days respectively. In the short period in which they are alive, adults lay 3–4 broods. The mean fertility of females is 160 eggs on the second and third nights after leaving the pupal stage and entering the adult stage. After laying her eggs, the female raisin moth does not stay to protect her eggs, instead abandoning them afterwards. The male raisin moth also plays no role in guarding or rearing its young.\n\nThe raisin moth has been observed to exhibit nocturnal flight patterns. It tends to be inactive during the day and begin significant activity at 7pm. Activity exponentially increases until it peaks at 8pm, when it then slowly levels off and reaches inactivity at 5am. Activity during this period consists of mating, as the moths do not forage in the adult phase.\n\nRaisin moth larvae face predation from competitors on dropped fruit. The mortality of the moth larvae in dropped fruit is higher in the presence of the fire ant Solenopsis aurea and the California harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex californicus. Both of these ants forage on dropped fruit, but will also consume the moth larvae if it is present.\n\nSeveral hymenopteran parasitoids such as Venturia canescens and Habrobracon hebetor harm raisin moth larvae. Specifically, Habrobracon hebetor stings and in effect parasitizes raisin moth larvae during warm winter days when they are located under tree bark. However, this parasitoid will not affect them during warmer seasons or on host plant fruit, so it is not effective as a natural pesticide. However, it can be used to effectively parasitize the larvae during storage.\n\nPheromones are chemical substances released into the environment which alter the behavior of other organisms in the same species. In terms of the raisin moth, the female begins the mating process by attracting male moths by releasing pheromones. These pheromones are quite similar to those from other moths in the Phycitinae subfamily, so elaborate courtship rituals are performed to avoid interspecies mating. Male moths also release a species specific pheromone that serves to reduce interspecies mating.\n\nA male raisin moth finds its way to the female moth by following the pheromone trail left by the female. As the male approaches he will first curl his abdomen such that it reaches over his head. Female will turn to face him depending on direction of approach. After the male curls his abdomen, his abdominal hair-pencils are exposed. After this, the female abdomen begins to rise and male and female join at a 30-40 degree angle from the ground. Mating is initiated by a process involving a head bump followed by a thrusting action. The thrusting is fairly accurate, with a 75% success rate on the first try, followed by nearly 100% success rate after the first successful attempt. Females exhibit a post-copulatory behavior that involves performance of a drag walk with the male moth. This consists of her dragging the male moth behind her for some time. These copulatory behaviors serve to avoid courtship by males of different species.\n\nThe raisin moth is classified as a pest throughout the world. It is especially known to cause severe qualitative and quantitative losses of dates. However, its larvae cause severe crop losses to almost all dried and drying fruits, as are specified in its diet. As the larvae feed on the insides of the fruit, it becomes filled with their excrement and fine powdery residue that is produced from the boring process. This leads to the fruit being filled with contaminants, which cannot be removed by post-harvest fumigation. Infestation can begin as soon as the fruit starts to ripen on the branches. In a study conducted in Iran, it was shown that initial infestation of the date fruit was only about 1.3%, but it peaked to 11.7% in mid-September, just months after initial fruit ripening in April. In the last month of the fruit cycle, in March, it was shown that up to 80% of the fruit was infected. More recent studies have shown that infection rates can be up to 90%.\n\nTo deter consumption of host plants, frequent application of chemical insecticides is often used. Mating disruption through the use of synthetic pheromone mimics is also an effective strategy and a greener alternative to pesticides. A specific pheromone, (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate, also known as TDA or ZETA, belongs to many species of pyralid moths and is a male attractant. Studies using this pheromone against the raisin moth showed that it greatly confused the male raisin moths and led to a reduction in larvae production. There is also some indication that blue neon light attracts raisin moths, which could potentially be used to deter the moth from laying eggs on fruit during mating season and lead to less larvae infestation in fruits.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) is a species of shark from the family Carcharhinidae, known for its yellowish color, which inspires its common name. It is classified as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Lemon sharks can grow to 3.4 metres (11 ft) in length. They are often found in shallow subtropical waters and are known to inhabit and return to specific nursery sites for breeding. Often feeding at night, these sharks use electroreceptors to find their main source of prey, fish. Lemon sharks enjoy the many benefits of group living such as enhanced communication, courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. This species of shark gives birth to  live young, and the females are polyandrous and have a biennial reproductive cycle. Lemon sharks are not thought to be a large threat to humans; there have been 10 recorded bites, none of which were life-threatening. The lemon shark's life span is unknown, but the average shark is 25 to 30 years old. The oldest recorded lemon shark in captivity died in 2023 at the age of 40 years.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The lemon shark was first named and described in 1868 by Felipe Poey. He originally named it Hypoprion brevirostris, but later renamed it Negaprion brevirostris. The lemon shark has also appeared in literature as Negaprion fronto and Carcharias fronto (Jordan and Gilbert, 1882), Carcharias brevirostris (Gunther, 1870), and Carcharhinus brevirostris (Henshall, 1891).\n\nThe shark's yellow colouring serves as an excellent camouflage when swimming over the sandy seafloor in its coastal habitat. The lemon shark commonly attains a length of 2.4 to 3.1 m (7.9 to 10.2 ft) and a weight up to 90 kg (200 lb) by adulthood, although sexual maturity is attained at 2.24 m (7.3 ft) in males and 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in females. The maximum recorded length and weight is 3.43 m (11.3 ft) and 183.7 kg (405 lb), respectively. It has a flattened head with a short, broad snout, and the second dorsal fin is almost as large as the first. Like all cartilaginous fish, lemon sharks have electroreceptors concentrated in their heads, known as the ampullae of Lorenzini. These receptors detect electrical pulses emitted by potential prey and allow these nocturnal feeders to sense their prey in the dark. Note that lemon sharks are often confused with bull sharks; lemon sharks have quite similarly sized first and second dorsal fins, whereas those of bull sharks are differently sized.\n\nLemon sharks are found from New Jersey to southern Brazil in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean. They also live off the coast of west Africa in the southeastern Atlantic. In addition, lemon sharks have been found in the eastern Pacific, from southern Baja California to Ecuador and in Cape Verde in Sal Island. This species of shark often occupies the subtropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, enclosed bays, and river mouths; however, lemon sharks have also been found in the open ocean down to depths of 92 meters (301 feet.) Although lemon sharks do swim up rivers, they never seem to travel very far into fresh water. They are found in open water primarily during migrations, and tend to stay along the continental and insular shelves for most of their lives.\n\nInformation about activity patterns and the use of space is important in understanding a species' behavioral ecology. Animals often make decisions about habitat use by evaluating their environment's abiotic conditions that serve as valuable indicators of good foraging sites or predator-safe locations. Lemon sharks select habitats in warm and shallow water with a rocky or sandy bottom.\n\nThe environmental temperature influences an individual's body temperature, which ultimately affects physiological processes such as growth and metabolism. Lemon sharks, therefore, select warm-water habitats to maintain optimal metabolic levels. They are believed to avoid areas with thick sea grasses because they make finding prey more difficult. Lemon sharks tend to live in or near shallow-water mangroves, which are often the nursery areas of several species of fish. The data gathered about the characteristics of shark nursery areas is mostly based on coastal species, this is due to their occurrence in bays, estuaries, river deltas, and shallow coastal waters.  One theory is that lemon sharks select mangrove habitats due to the abundance of prey that resides there, while another theory posits that mangroves provide a safe haven from adult lemon sharks that occasionally feed on juvenile sharks and are unable to enter the shallow waters. Ontogenetic niche shifts, or changes in an animal's niche breadth or position, to deeper waters are known to occur in relation to a lemon shark's size. These changes occur due to the dramatic decrease in the risk of predation as body size increases. Habitat selection clearly depends on a variety of biological and environmental variables.\n\nThe mangrove areas that lemon sharks inhabit are often referred to as their nursery sites. A nursery site is best defined as the most common area sharks are encountered, the location sharks tend to remain at after birth or frequently return to, and the habitat used by shark groups repeatedly for several years. The nursery ground concept has been known and studied for at least a century. In addition, fossil evidence from 320 million years ago suggests the use of shallow, coastal areas as pupping grounds is primitive.\n\nLemon sharks have proven to be an ideal model species to challenge the belief that all sharks are asynchronous opportunistic predators due to their tendency to use nursery areas for an extended period of time. Lemon shark feeding behaviors are easy to determine because their well-defined home ranges are conducive to accurate calculations of both the amount and types of prey in the environment and diet of a lemon shark.\n\nLemon sharks feed at night and are mainly piscivorous; however, they have been known to feed on crustaceans and benthic organisms. Intraspecific predation, or cannibalism, of juvenile lemon sharks by larger conspecifics has also been documented. Rather than feeding randomly, lemon sharks display a high degree of preference for certain species and size of prey when environmental conditions are favorable. They also tend to prefer a prey when it is more abundant and available. Lemon sharks feed selectively on species that are slower and more easily captured by using a stalking technique. For example, parrotfish and mojarras are common prey in the Bahamas because they use camouflage rather than an escape response and are vulnerable due to their stationary foraging behavior. Lemon sharks feed on prey that are intermediate in size compared to other available prey. This tendency can be explained by the tradeoff between the probability of capture and the profitability when it comes to prey size. The general trend in the foraging behavior of lemon sharks conforms to the optimal foraging theory, which suggests a positive relationship between prey selectivity and availability.\n\nRather than rolling on their sides to rip off chunks of prey, lemon sharks approach their victim with speed only to brake suddenly using their pectoral fins upon contact. The animal then jabs forward multiple times until it has a good grasp of its prey in its jaw and proceeds to shake its head from side to side until it tears off a chunk of flesh. A feeding frenzy, or large swarm of other sharks, then forms as the individuals sense the blood and bodily fluids released from the prey. Sounds of struggling prey also attract groups of sharks, suggesting they use sound detection for predation. Group feeding behavior such as pack hunting or communal scavenging was observed in a study in which pieces of the same stingray were found in the stomachs of several lemon shark individuals that were caught and examined.\n\nMany species of sharks, including the lemon shark, are known to actively prefer to be social and live in groups or loose aggregations. A few benefits of group living are enhanced communication, courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. Group living and a preference for social interaction is thought to be important for the survival and success of juvenile lemon sharks. Group living, though, comes with its costs. A few include increased risk of disease, ease of parasite transmission, and competition for resources.\n\nLemon sharks are found in groups based on similar size. Passive sorting mechanisms such as its ontogenetic habitat shift have been postulated to contribute to the formation of groups organized based on size or sex. One exception to this behavior is that sharks up to one year old show no preference for groups of matched or unmatched size. One hypothesis for this finding is that it is beneficial for the small young lemon sharks to associate with the larger individuals because they have an easier time gathering information about the habitat regarding elements such as predators and local prey. Lemon shark groups form due to an active desire to be social rather than a simple attraction to the same limited resources such as the mangrove habitat and prey associated with such a habitat.\n\nMany studies have related brain size with complex social behaviors in mammals and birds. The brain of a lemon shark, being comparable in relative mass to that of a mammal or bird, suggests they have the ability to learn from social interactions, cooperate with other individuals, and have the potential to establish dominance hierarchies and stable social bonds.\n\nLemon sharks congregate for reproduction at special mating grounds. Females give birth to their young in shallow nursery waters to which they are philopatric. Lemon shark young are known as pups and they tend to remain in the nursery area for several years before venturing into deeper waters. Lemon sharks are viviparous, meaning that the mother directly transfers nutrients to her young via a yolk-sac placenta and the young are born alive. Fertilization is internal and occurs after a male lemon shark holds a female, bites her, and inserts his clasper into her cloaca. Female lemon sharks are polyandrous and sperm competition occurs due to their ability to store sperm in an oviducal gland for several months. Several studies suggest that polyandry in female lemon sharks has adapted out of convenience, rather than indirect genetic benefits to offspring. This type of polyandry is termed as convenience polyandry because females are believed to mate multiple times to avoid harassment by males. Females have a biennial reproductive cycle, requiring a year for gestation and another year for oogenesis and vitellogenesis after parturition. Lemon sharks reach sexual maturity around 12–16 years of age and have low fecundity. Males tend to mature earlier than females. The maximum number of pups recorded in a litter is 18.\n\nThis species of shark is best known in its behavior and ecology, mainly due to the work of Samuel Gruber at the University of Miami, who studied the lemon shark both in the field and in the laboratory from 1967. The population around the Bimini Islands in the western Bahamas, where Gruber's Bimini Biological Field Station is situated, is probably the best known of all shark populations.\n\nThe lemon shark is targeted by commercial and recreational fishers along the U.S. Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and in the eastern Pacific Ocean due to its prized meat, fins, and skin. Lemon shark skin may be used for leather and its meat can be consumed and is believed to be a delicacy in many cultures. Concern exists that over-fishing has led the lemon shark populations in the western north Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean to decline. It is considered vulnerable.\n\nLemon sharks do not represent a large threat to humans. The International Shark Attack File lists 11 unprovoked lemon shark bites, none of which were fatal.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe American woodcock (Scolopax minor), sometimes colloquially referred to as the timberdoodle, mudbat, bogsucker, night partridge, or Labrador twister is a small shorebird species found primarily in the eastern half of North America. Woodcocks spend most of their time on the ground in brushy, young-forest habitats, where the birds' brown, black, and gray plumage provides excellent camouflage.\n\nThe American woodcock is the only species of woodcock inhabiting North America. Although classified with the sandpipers and shorebirds in the family Scolopacidae, the American woodcock lives mainly in upland settings. Its many folk names include timberdoodle, bogsucker, night partridge, brush snipe, hokumpoke, and becasse.\n\nThe population of the American woodcock has fallen by an average of slightly more than 1% annually since the 1960s. Most authorities attribute this decline to a loss of habitat caused by forest maturation and urban development. Because of the male woodcock's unique, beautiful courtship flights, the bird is welcomed as a harbinger of spring in northern areas. It is also a popular game bird, with about 540,000 killed annually by some 133,000 hunters in the U.S.\n\nIn 2008, wildlife biologists and conservationists released an American woodcock conservation plan presenting figures for the acreage of early successional habitat that must be created and maintained in the U.S. and Canada to stabilize the woodcock population at current levels, and to return it to 1970s densities.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The American woodcock has a plump body, short legs, a large, rounded head, and a long, straight prehensile bill. Adults are 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) long and weigh 5 to 8 ounces (140 to 230 g). Females are considerably larger than males. The bill is 2.5 to 2.8 inches (6.4 to 7.1 cm) long. Wingspans range from 16.5 to 18.9 inches (42 to 48 cm).\n\nThe plumage is a cryptic mix of different shades of browns, grays, and black. The chest and sides vary from yellowish-white to rich tans. The nape of the head is black, with three or four crossbars of deep buff or rufous. The feet and toes, which are small and weak, are brownish gray to reddish brown. Woodcocks have large eyes located high in their heads, and their visual field is probably the largest of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane and 180° in the vertical plane.\n\nThe woodcock uses its long, prehensile bill to probe in the soil for food, mainly invertebrates and especially earthworms. A unique bone-and-muscle arrangement lets the bird open and close the tip of its upper bill, or mandible, while it is sunk in the ground. Both the underside of the upper mandible and the long tongue are rough-surfaced for grasping slippery prey.\n\nThe genus Scolopax was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. The genus name is Latin for a snipe or woodcock. The type species is the Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola).\n\nWoodcocks inhabit forested and mixed forest-agricultural-urban areas east of the 98th meridian. Woodcock have been sighted as far north as York Factory, Manitoba, and east to Labrador and Newfoundland. In winter, they migrate as far south as the Gulf Coast of the United States and Mexico.\n\nThe primary breeding range extends from Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick) west to southeastern Manitoba, and south to northern Virginia, western North Carolina, Kentucky, northern Tennessee, northern Illinois, Missouri, and eastern Kansas. A limited number breed as far south as Florida and Texas. The species may be expanding its distribution northward and westward.\n\nAfter migrating south in autumn, most woodcocks spend the winter in the Gulf Coast and southeastern Atlantic Coast states. Some may remain as far north as southern Maryland, eastern Virginia, and southern New Jersey. The core of the wintering range centers on Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Based on the Christmas Bird Count results, winter concentrations are highest in the northern half of Alabama.\n\nAmerican woodcocks live in wet thickets, moist woods, and brushy swamps. Ideal habitats feature early successional habitat and abandoned farmland mixed with forest. In late summer, some woodcocks roost on the ground at night in large openings among sparse, patchy vegetation.\n\nWoodcocks migrate at night. They fly at low altitudes, individually or in small, loose flocks. Flight speeds of migrating birds have been clocked at 16 to 28 mi/h (26 to 45 km/h). However, the slowest flight speed ever recorded for a bird, 5 mi/h (8 km/h), was recorded for this species. Woodcocks are thought to orient visually using major physiographic features such as coastlines and broad river valleys. Both the autumn and spring migrations are leisurely compared with the swift, direct migrations of many passerine birds.\n\nIn the north, woodcocks begin to shift southward before ice and snow seal off their ground-based food supply. Cold fronts may prompt heavy southerly flights in autumn. Most woodcocks start to migrate in October, with the major push from mid-October to early November. Most individuals arrive on the wintering range by mid-December. The birds head north again in February. Most have returned to the northern breeding range by mid-March to mid-April.\n\nMigrating birds' arrival at and departure from the breeding range is highly irregular. In Ohio, for example, the earliest birds are seen in February, but the bulk of the population does not arrive until March and April. Birds start to leave for winter by September, but some remain until mid-November.\n\nWoodcocks eat mainly invertebrates, particularly earthworms (Oligochaeta). They do most of their feeding in places where the soil is moist. They forage by probing in soft soil in thickets, where they usually remain well-hidden. Other items in their diet include insect larvae, snails, centipedes, millipedes, spiders, snipe flies, beetles, and ants. A small amount of plant food is eaten, mainly seeds. Woodcocks are crepuscular, being most active at dawn and dusk.\n\nIn spring, males occupy individual singing grounds, openings near brushy cover from which they call and perform display flights at dawn and dusk, and if the light levels are high enough, on moonlit nights. The male's ground call is a short, buzzy peent. After sounding a series of ground calls, the male takes off and flies from 50 to 100 yd (46 to 91 m) into the air. He descends, zigzagging and banking while singing a liquid, chirping song. This high spiralling flight produces a melodious twittering sound as air rushes through the male's outer primary wing feathers.\n\nMales may continue with their courtship flights for as many as four months running, sometimes continuing even after females have already hatched their broods and left the nest. Females, known as hens, are attracted to the males' displays. A hen will fly in and land on the ground near a singing male. The male courts the female by walking stiff-legged and with his wings stretched vertically, and by bobbing and bowing. A male may mate with several females. The male woodcock plays no role in selecting a nest site, incubating eggs, or rearing young. In the primary northern breeding range, the woodcock may be the earliest ground-nesting species to breed.\n\nThe hen makes a shallow, rudimentary nest on the ground in the leaf and twig litter, in brushy or young-forest cover usually within 150 yd (140 m) of a singing ground. Most hens lay four eggs, sometimes one to three. Incubation takes 20 to 22 days. The down-covered young are precocial and leave the nest within a few hours of hatching. The female broods her young and feeds them. When threatened, the fledglings usually take cover and remain motionless, attempting to escape detection by relying on their cryptic coloration. Some observers suggest that frightened young may cling to the body of their mother, that will then take wing and carry the young to safety. Woodcock fledglings begin probing for worms on their own a few days after hatching. They develop quickly and can make short flights after two weeks, can fly fairly well at three weeks, and are independent after about five weeks.\n\nThe maximum lifespan of adult American woodcock in the wild is 8 years.\n\nAmerican woodcocks occasionally perform a rocking behavior where they will walk slowly while rhythmically rocking their bodies back and forth. This behavior occurs during foraging, leading ornithologists such as Arthur Cleveland Bent and B. H. Christy to theorize that this is a method of coaxing invertebrates such as earthworms closer to the surface. The foraging theory is the most common explanation of the behavior, and it is often cited in field guides.\n\nAn alternative theory for the rocking behavior has been proposed by some biologists, such as Bernd Heinrich. It is thought that this behavior is a display to indicate to potential predators that the bird is aware of them. Heinrich notes that some field observations have shown that woodcocks will occasionally flash their tail feathers while rocking, drawing attention to themselves. This theory is supported by research done by John Alcock who believes this is a type of aposematism.\n\nHow many woodcock were present in eastern North America before European settlement is unknown. Colonial agriculture, with its patchwork of family farms and open-range livestock grazing, probably supported healthy woodcock populations.\n\nThe woodcock population remained high during the early and mid-20th century, after many family farms were abandoned as people moved to urban areas, and crop fields and pastures grew up in brush. In recent decades, those formerly brushy acres have become middle-aged and older forest, where woodcock rarely venture, or they have been covered with buildings and other human developments. Because its population has been declining, the American woodcock is considered a \"species of greatest conservation need\" in many states, triggering research and habitat-creation efforts in an attempt to boost woodcock populations.\n\nPopulation trends have been measured through springtime breeding bird surveys, and in the northern breeding range, springtime singing-ground surveys. Data suggest that the woodcock population has fallen rangewide by an average of 1.1% yearly over the last four decades.\n\nThe American woodcock is not considered globally threatened by the IUCN. It is more tolerant of deforestation than other woodcocks and snipes; as long as some sheltered woodland remains for breeding, it can thrive even in regions that are mainly used for agriculture.  The estimated population is 5 million, so it is the most common sandpiper in North America.\n\nThe American Woodcock Conservation Plan presents regional action plans linked to bird conservation regions, fundamental biological units recognized by the U.S. North American Bird Conservation Initiative. The Wildlife Management Institute oversees regional habitat initiatives intended to boost the American woodcock's population by protecting, renewing, and creating habitat throughout the species' range.\n\nCreating young-forest habitat for American woodcocks helps more than 50 other species of wildlife that need early successional habitat during part or all of their lifecycles. These include relatively common animals such as white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, moose, bobcat, wild turkey, and ruffed grouse, and animals whose populations have also declined in recent decades, such as the golden-winged warbler, whip-poor-will, willow flycatcher, indigo bunting, and New England cottontail.\n\nLeslie Glasgow, the assistant secretary of the Interior for Fish, Wildlife, Parks, and Marine Resources from 1969 to 1970, wrote a dissertation through Texas A&M University on the woodcock, with research based on his observations through the Louisiana State University (LSU) Agricultural Experiment Station. He was an LSU professor from 1948 to 1980 and an authority on wildlife in the wetlands.",

They measure 14 cm long and weigh 12–18 g. One species inhabits the Big Island, another Oʻahu and the third Kauaʻi. Being one of the most adaptable native birds of Hawaiʻi, no subspecies have yet become extinct, though two have become quite rare.\n\nThe ʻelepaio is the first native bird to sing in the morning and the last to stop singing at night; apart from whistled and chattering contact and alarm calls, it is probably best known for its song, from which derives the common name: a pleasant and rather loud warble which sounds like e-le-PAI-o or ele-PAI-o. It nests between January and June.",
      "sections":"The genus Chasiempis contains three species:\n\nUniquely among Hawaiian passerines, the distribution of the ʻelepaio is peculiarly discontinuous. According to fossil remains, the birds did not occur on Maui Nui or its successor islands. Their current distribution is absent from the Maui Nui island group. If this assumption is correct, the reasons are unknown at present. However, the strange \"flycatcher finches\", extinct honeycreepers of the genus Vangulifer, are only known to have inhabited Maui and probably evolved on Maui Nui. There, they probably filled the same ecological niche as the ʻelepaio did on the other islands. Competition from Vangulifer may thus have prevented a successful colonization of Maui Nui by Chasiempis.\n\nIn Hawaiian tradition, the ʻelepaio was among the most celebrated of the birds. It is associated with a number of significant roles in culture and mythology. Chiefly, it helped kālai waʻa (canoe-builders) to select the right koa tree to use for their waʻa (canoe). The ʻelepaio is a bold and curious little bird, and thus it was attracted to humans whom it found working in its habitat, and it quickly learned to exploit feeding opportunities created by human activity, altering its behavior accordingly – which incidentally made it even more conspicuous.\n\nFor example, it followed canoe builders through dense vegetation, watching them as they searched for suitable trees. They considered it their guardian spirit, an incarnation of their patron goddess Lea, because if the bird pecked at a fallen tree, it was a sign that the tree was riddled with burrowing insects and thus not good anymore, but when the bird showed no interest in a tree, it indicated that the wood was suitable. This is the origin of the ancient Hawaiian proverb, ʻUā ʻelepaio ʻia ka waʻa (\"The canoe is marked out by the ʻelepaio\"). Due to its insectivorous habit, farmers believed the ʻelepaio to be the incarnation of Lea's sister goddess, Hina-puku-ʻai, who protected food plants and was a patron of agriculture.\n\nAlthough deforestation for agriculture destroyed large areas of habitat, the ʻelepaio managed to adapt well to the initial settlement. Thus, its population was large enough to withstand the additional pressures that came about with Western colonization of the islands. However, the Oʻahu species has declined precipitously in recent years and is now endangered.",

Fewer than 50 individuals are thought to exist.  Its habitat lies in a transitional zone between three ecoregions: dry spiny bush, humid littoral forest, and humid forest.  First collected in 2001 and thought to be a subpopulation of the furry-eared dwarf lemur (C. crossleyi), it was not formally described until 2013.  It is one of six species of dwarf lemur, though the research that identified it also suggested the existence of many more new species.",

      "sections":"The Lavasoa dwarf lemur belongs to the genus Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs) within the family Cheirogaleidae.\nBetween October 2001 and December 2006, researchers collected ten mature adults (five male and five female) along with six immature individuals. The lemurs were released after they were measured and small tissue samples were taken from their ears.  The  holotype (AH-X-00-181) was an adult male, captured, recorded, and released at Petit Lavasoa on 10 October 2001.  The analysis was published in 2013 by Dana Thiele and Andreas Hapke of Johannes Gutenberg University and Emilienne Razafimahatratra of the University of Antananarivo.\n\nIn the two decades prior to 2013, only two dwarf lemur species were known, but in 2000 primatologist Colin Groves raised the number to seven based on morphological data acquired from museum samples.  However, in 2009 and 2011, two of these new species were rejected.  The Lavasoa dwarf lemur, named for the Lavasoa Mountains in southern Madagascar, became the sixth known species in 2013 when it was differentiated from the furry-eared dwarf lemur (C. crossleyi) through analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear material performed by a team of German and Malagasy researchers.  Furthermore, their research suggested the existence of three more new dwarf lemur species that they provisionally named Cheirogaleus sp. Ranomafana Andrambovato, Cheirogaleus sp. Bekaraoka Sambava, and Cheirogaleus sp. Ambanja, based on the regions the samples were collected. The Lavasoa dwarf lemur is most closely related to C. sp. Ranomafana/Andrambovato.  The authors speculated that even greater species diversity may be found among dwarf lemurs by future studies due to their large geographic range and the great genetic distance exhibited within the genus.\n\nThe Lavasoa dwarf lemur is a small lemur, weighing 0.3 kg (0.66 lb) and measuring 50–55 cm (20–22 in) in length.  Its eyes are surrounded by black fur that forms a 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) ring around the eyes.  The black fur runs from the eyes to the animal's pointed nose.  The rest of the fur on its head is reddish-brown, except for a thin strip between the eyes which is lighter in color.  The back of the Lavasoa dwarf lemur is reddish-brown at the neck which fades to gray-brown at the posterior end.  The underside of the lemur is a cream color.  Hands and feet are grey-brown in most individuals, but reddish-brown in a minority.  Throughout the animal exhibits dichromatic hairs with gray bases.\n\nThe Lavasoa dwarf lemur can be distinguished from the furry-eared dwarf lemur by its wider ears and smaller head.  It can be distinguished from its closest relative, Cheirogaleus sp. Ranomafana Andrambovato, by these two traits plus a shorter tail.  The coloration patterns are very similar between all three species.  This coloration pattern contrasts with Lavasoa dwarf lemur's closest geographic neighbors, the greater dwarf lemur (C. major) and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (C. medius).\n\nLike other dwarf lemurs, the Lavasoa dwarf lemur is nocturnal and arboreal, living in the upper canopy of the forest.  During the dry winter, they hibernate for several months.  Little is known about their behavior because they are primarily active during the rainy season, at which time the forests become challenging for scientists to reach.\n\nThe Lavasoa dwarf lemur is endemic to the southern slopes of the Lavasoa Mountains in the Anosy Region of Madagascar.  It is only found in three small fragmentary forests (Grand Lavasoa, Petit Lavasoa, and Ambatotsirongorongo), located within a transitional zone between dry spiny bush, humid littoral forest, and humid forest.  Despite containing some flora from the drier regions, its habitat general resembles humid forests.\n\nThe three forest fragments in which the Lavasoa dwarf lemur is found used to be a part of a larger forest that once covered the southern range of the Lavasoa Mountains, as illustrated by aerial photographs from 1957.  These remaining forest fragments are contained within a new protected area around Ambatotsirongorongo (Nouvelle Aire Protégée Ambatotsirongorongo), which is part of the national service of protected areas (Système des Aires Protégées de Madagascar, SAPM).

It was formerly called T. dianae, but that has been shown to be a junior synonym.\n\nIt is highly adapted to vertical clinging and leaping, like other tarsiers, and has a strict live animal diet, consisting mostly of insects. Due to human intervention in the forest of South-east Asia, Dian's tarsier tends to adapt its ranging behavior based on the degree of human intervention. Slightly disturbed habitats have been shown to have little effect on the Dian's tarsier, but with larger disturbances, the habitat is less suitable.\n\nFirst claimed as a new species by Miller and Hollister in 1921.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Dian's tarsier was named in 1991 in honor of the Roman goddess of hunting Diana and the late Dian Fossey.\n\nThe weight of adult Dian's tarsier ranges from 100 to 150 grams. This species is characterized by a greyish buff color to their wooly fur, a black spot is present on each side of the nose and white-colored fur appears on the middle lower lip and on both sides of the upper lip.\n\nDian's tarsier is found in the primary rainforest of the lower mountains of central Sulawesi. It can also be found in habitat modified (disturbed) by humans such as secondary forests with logging, agroforestry or intensive agriculture.\n\nGroups can range from two to seven individuals.  Each group is composed of one adult male paired with one to three adult females and their offspring, which can be male and female juveniles.\n\nFemales of this species typically give birth to one child per year. Reproduction does not appear to vary by season. Dian's tarsiers use infant parking.\n\nThis species is most active after dusk and before dawn. After dusk, Dian's tarsiers leave the sleeping sites they use during the day, traverse completely their home range, and go hunt for food in their home range at night where they will be more stationary during hunting and eating. Before dawn, duet vocalisation signals to other members of the group to return to the sleeping site. Dian's tarsiers can travel more than 100 meters to reach their sleeping site in under 15 minutes before dawn. They use forest undergrowth to move.\n\nHome ranges of mated males and females pairs overlap. There is slight overlap between the home ranges of different groups. The male home range is slightly larger than the female's in undisturbed habitat with average home ranges sizes of 1.77 hectares and 1.58 hectares respectively.\n\nThis species shows sexually dimorphic morning duet vocalization. The majority of duet calls are started by the female. The female starts with a high pitched rapid series of notes. The pitch lowers towards the middle of the song where most commonly a trill will be made, other options include long notes. The pitch increases towards the end of the song. The male will sing at the same time as his mate. He sings a rapid series of notes that start with a low pitch and end in a high pitch. Songs have a median close to one minute in length. The end of the songs have more and irregularly spaced time between notes. These calls are specific to this species of tarsiers, as no other species of tarsiers responded to them.\n\nStrangler fig trees are the preferred sleeping site for Dian's tarsier. The individuals will sleep in crevices or opening in the tree. Although this species is also able to sleep in bamboo stands and dense shrubbery which are more common in degraded habitats. Members of the same group will sleep in the same site during the day. Typically, groups will return to the same sleeping site night after night, though they can change site, particularly if the area was disturbed. Some groups have been seen using two or more regular sites. Sleeping sites are typically located on the boundary of the home range, possibly to renew the scent of animals on their territory.\n\nDian's tarsier eats most commonly crickets, grasshoppers and moths.\n\nDian's tarsier species is in decline. The lowest population density found in 1998 was the highest population density found in 2000-2001.\n\nIn Sulawesi, including in national parks such as the Lore Lindu National Park, old growth rainforest is being altered by humans. Logging of primary forest trees and illegal logging deteriorate the Dian's tarsier habitat. Other commercial avenues used on this land include: bamboo and rattan logging, and plantation of cash crops, such as cocoa and coffee, all plants that are not native to the area. Between 2000 and 2017, the Dian's tarsier lost 10% of its total forest habitat and 4% of its protected forest habitat.\n\nPopulation density is the highest by far in undisturbed habitat at 57.1 groups/km2. All levels of disturbed habitat where Dian's tarsiers are found show similar population densities (32.9 groups/km2-38.0 groups/km2), with heavily disturbed habitats showing the lowest.\n\nHome ranges of females in low and moderate levels of human disturbed habitat are smaller than in undisturbed habitat. Home ranges in habitats heavily disturbed by humans are larger than in all other habitats. Researchers hypothesize that this is due to the increased number of insects in slightly disturbed habitat. This slightly disturbed habitat has more canopy openings which may attract more insects. The largest home ranges are in the most disturbed habitats, these also have the least insects, likely due to the use of pesticides in plantations.\n\nNightly paths lengths are similar in males and females in undisturbed habitat. Female path length increases with increased human disturbance of the habitat. Since nightly path length is related to energy expenditure, Dian's tarsiers expend more energy in more disturbed habitats. Females typically cover more of their home range in one night in low and moderate levels of disturbance in their habitats.\n\nMaintaining forest habitat by stopping illegal logging, practicing agroforestry, protecting sleeping sites and preserving forest undergrowth would allow Dian's tarsier to live in a habitat with low levels of degradation. Better public knowledge that Dian's tarsier does not eat cash crops and instead eats insects, as well as reducing the use of chemical pesticides, would also help.",

At night, it spreads its arms to form a basket to feed on plankton.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"This species is a typical basket star, with arms divided into five sections,[clarification needed] with many smaller arms branching off of these sections. The arms can range throughout a variety of lengths both within and among individuals of Astroboa nuda. Shorter arms help the basket stars attach themselves to a substrate, and may also help carry food from the longer arms, which catch prey, to the mouth.\n\nA. nuda have a simple digestive system, consisting of an esophagus connected to a sac-like stomach. They have no anus or intestines. The mouth is found on the underside of the body. The waste product of basket stars comes in the form of ammonia, and is removed from the body through diffusion.\n\nThe type specimen of Astroboa nuda was described in 1874 as Astrophyton nudum, from a specimen collected in the Philippines by \"Semper\". The specimen was noted as having \"No tentacle scales on pores. Disk and arms quite smooth; the latter ringed with faint lines, which, magnified, are seen to be rows of minute conical papillae[disambiguation needed]. One large madreporic body.\" The species possesses twenty arms which are smooth, lacking spines or \"grains\"; upon closer inspection a network of \"cross-lines\" are visible. Each joint of the arms is marked by a ridge of papillae, which are made up of hooks that become more annular farther up the arm, \"encircling the arm in a single row\" on the distal-most part of the arms. The disk is \"essentially naked\" or unornamented, which may be the reason for this basket star's name, although this was not directly stated. The \"mouth-papillae\", teeth, and \"tooth-papillae\" are of a uniform spiniform shape, three of which \"represent teeth\" are longer than the others. The madreporic body is at the \"inner angle\" of the interbrachial space, near the delineation of the animal's upper and lower surface. This specimen's color lightens at the tips, being yellowish brown after some time in alcohol. It is now labeled with the specimen number MCZ OPH-2911.\n\nLive A. nuda are usually dark violet, black, or dark brown in color, but can occasionally be pale yellow. Typically, the yellow A. nuda tend to be larger. This variation in color and size have not been shown to cause differences in behavior.\n\nAstroboa nuda are found throughout the tropical seas of the Indo-Pacific, occurring in the Gulf of Aqaba at its northernmost range, down south to Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa, and eastwards to the seas around Indonesia, the Philippines, the northern coast of Australia, New Caledonia, and Vanuatu.\n\nLike other gorgonocephalids, they are benthic, commonly being found on the seafloor at depths greater than twenty meters, burrowing into the sandy bottom. They are also found buried in mud, or within the holes of rocks or coral and occasionally in submarine canyons.[dubious – discuss][inconsistent] Unlike some other species within Ophiuroidea that form aggregations, Astroboa nuda are usually found alone or in groups of two to four.\n\nAstroboa nuda is a filter feeder and usually feeds on plankton, such as the larvae of decapods and copepods, as well as those of fish. They may also occasionally obtain food from the surface of the substrate which they attach to.[citation needed] Typically, due to their light sensitivity, A. nuda hides in nearby shelters during the day, but branch out at night to feed; a high-powered electric torch may induce a similar retreat to shelter. They feed from approximately two hours after sunset, to about one hour before sunrise. They usually return to the same spot every night, and are active during all seasons of the year. They prefer calm, lightly disturbed waters. If the area is heavily disturbed causing irregular current, they usually remain sheltered behind coral heads, or other sections of the reef.\n\nThe class Ophiuroidea usually reproduces sexually, although asexual reproduction by fission can occur as well. Typically, there are separate male and female basket stars, which release sperm and eggs into the water. The sperm and eggs then join, and the larvae develop in the water; this process is known as broadcast spawning. Astroboa nuda itself has been observed off Egypt to broadcast spawn 6 to 5 days before the full moon, spawning in synchrony with Tectus dentatus, Leiaster cf. leachi, Mithrodia clavigera, Pearsonothuria graeffei, and Tridacna maxima.\n\nBasket stars generally have very few predators, as they are low in nutritional value, but are preyed upon by some fish.[clarification needed] They may break off part or all of one of their arms in order to escape, but these arms will regenerate. Basket stars are often also caught by humans as part of by-catch during commercial fishing.\n\nCardinalfish of the genus Apogon may shelter amongst the arms of Astroboa nuda, apparently feeding on the food captured by the basket star. A. nuda also serves as a host to large copepod populations. These copepods, of the species Doridicola connexus (Lichomolgidae) and Collocherides singularis (Asterocheridae) live in the stomach of the basket stars. In addition, C. singularis, C. astroboae, D. connexus, and D. micropus also live as ectoparasites.",

      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Kangaroo rats are four or five-toed heteromyid rodents with big hind legs, small front legs, and relatively large heads. Adults typically weigh between 70 and 170 grams (2.5 and 6.0 oz) The tails of kangaroo rats are longer than both their bodies and their heads. Another notable feature of kangaroo rats is their fur-lined cheek pouches, which are used for storing food. The coloration of kangaroo rats varies from cinnamon buff to dark gray, depending on the species. There is also some variation in length with one of the largest species, the banner-tailed kangaroo rat being six inches in body length and a tail length of eight inches. Sexual dimorphism exists in all species, with males being larger than females.\n\nKangaroo rats move bipedally. Kangaroo rats often leap a distance of 7 feet, and reportedly up to 9 feet (2.75 m)\nat speeds up to almost 10 feet/sec, or 10 km/h (6 mph). They can quickly change direction between jumps. The rapid locomotion of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat may minimize energy cost and predation risk. Its use of a \"move-freeze\" mode may also make it less conspicuous to nocturnal predators.\n\nKangaroo rats live in arid and semiarid areas, particularly on sandy or soft soils which are suitable for burrowing. They can, however, vary in both geographic range and habitat. Their elevation range depends on the species; they are found from below sea level to at least 7,100 feet (the type locality of D. ordii priscus).  They are sensitive to extreme temperatures and remain in their burrows during rain storms and other forms of inclement weather.  Kangaroo rats are preyed on by coyotes, foxes, badgers, weasels, owls, and snakes.\n\nMerriam's kangaroo rats live in areas of low rainfall and humidity, and high summer temperature and evaporation rates. They prefer areas of stony soils, including clays, gravel, and rocks, which are harder than soils preferred by some other species (like banner-tailed kangaroo rats). Because their habitats are hot and dry, they must conserve water. They do this in part by lowering their metabolic rate, which reduces the loss of water through their skin and respiratory system. Evaporation through the skin is the major route of loss. Merriam's kangaroo rats obtain enough water from the metabolic oxidation of the seeds they eat to survive and do not need to drink water at all. To help conserve water they produce very concentrated urine, via a process apparently associated with expression of aquaporin 1 along a longer than usual segment of the descending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney.\n\nIn contrast, banner-tailed kangaroo rats have more specific habitat requirements for desert grasslands with scattered shrubs; this species is also more threatened because of the decline in these grasslands. These are also dry areas but they tend to have more water available to them than Merriam's kangaroo rats.\n\nKangaroo rats are primarily seed eaters.  They will, however, eat vegetation occasionally, and at some times of the year, possibly insects as well. They have been seen storing the seeds of mesquite, creosote bush, purslane, ocotillo, and grama grass in their cheek pouches. Kangaroo rats will store extra seeds in seed caches. This caching behavior affects the rangeland and croplands where the animals live. Kangaroo rats must harvest as much seed as possible in as little time as possible.  To conserve energy and water, they minimize their time away from their cool, dry burrows. In addition, maximizing time in their burrows minimizes their exposure to predators.\n\nWhen on foraging trips, kangaroo rats hoard the seeds that they find. It is important for a kangaroo rat to encounter more food items than are consumed, at least at one point in the year, as well as defend or rediscover food caches and remain within the same areas long enough to utilize food resources. Different species of kangaroo rat may have different seed caching strategies to coexist with each other, as is the case for the banner-tailed kangaroo rat and Merriam's kangaroo rat which have overlapping ranges. Merriam's kangaroo rats scatterhoard small caches of seeds in numerous small, shallow holes they dig. This is initially done close to the food source, maximizing harvest rates and reducing travel costs, but later redistributed more widely, minimizing theft by other rodents. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats larderhoard a sizable cache of seeds within the large mounds they occupy. This could decrease their time and energy expenses; they also spend less time on the surface digging holes, reducing the risk of predation. Being larger and more sedentary, they are better able to defend these larders from depredations by other rodents.\n\nKangaroo rats inhabit overlapping home ranges. These home ranges tend to be small with most  activities within 200–300 ft and rarely 600 ft. Home range size can vary within species with Merriam's kangaroo rats having larger home ranges than banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Recently weaned kangaroo rats move into new areas not occupied by adults. Within its home range, a kangaroo rat has a defended territory consisting of its burrowing system.\n\nKangaroo rats live in complex burrow systems. The burrows have separate chambers used for specific purposes like sleeping, living, and food storage. The spacing of the burrows depends on the number of kangaroo rats and the abundance of food. Kangaroo rats also live in colonies that range from six to several hundred dens. The burrow of a kangaroo rat is important in providing protection from the harsh desert environment. To maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity in their burrows, kangaroo rats plug the entrances with soil during the day. When the outside temperature is too hot, a kangaroo rat stays in its cool, humid burrow and leaves it only at night. To reduce loss of moisture through respiration when sleeping, a kangaroo rat buries its nose in its fur to accumulate a small pocket of moist air. The burrows of Merriam's kangaroo rats are simpler and shallower than those of banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats also mate in their burrows, unlike Merriam's kangaroo rats.\n\nKangaroo rats are generally solitary animals with little social organization. Kangaroo rats communicate during competitive interactions and courtship. They do cluster together in some feeding situations. Groups of kangaroo rats that exist are aggregations and colonies. There appears to be a dominance hierarchy among male kangaroo rats in competition for access to females. Male kangaroo rats are generally more aggressive than females and are more dominant over them. Females are more tolerant of each other than males are and have more non-aggressive interactions. This is likely in part because the home ranges of females overlap less than the home ranges of males. Linear dominance hierarchies appear to exist among males but it is not known if this is the case for females. Winners of aggressive encounters appear to be the most active individuals.\n\nKangaroo rats have a promiscuous mating system. Their reproductive output is highest in summer following high rainfalls. During droughts and food shortages, only a few females will breed. It appears that kangaroo rats can assess their local conditions and adjust their reproductive efforts accordingly. Merriam's kangaroo rats breed between February and May and produce two or three litters per year. Before mating, the male and female will perform nasal-anal circling until the female stops and allows the male to mount her. A Merriam's kangaroo rat female will allow multiple males to mount her in a short time, perhaps to ensure greater chances of producing offspring. Mating in banner-tailed kangaroo rats involves more chasing and foot drumming in the male before the female allows him to mate. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats mate on mounds and the more successful males chase away rival males. The gestation period of kangaroo rats lasts 22–27 days.\n\nThe young are born in a fur-lined nest in the burrows. They are born blind and hairless. For the first week, young Merriam kangaroo rats crawl, developing their hind legs in their second or third week. At this time, the young become independent. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats are weaned between 22 and 25 days. Offspring remain in the mound for 1-6 more months in the maternal caches.",

The face, neck, and underside lack a bony covering and are instead covered with small bunches of hair.\n\nDasypus species are grey or brown in color and possess long and sharp claws for scavenging and digging burrows.  Although they have a very diverse range, armadillos are typically found near bodies of water, and their burrows are often dug into stream banks, tree stumps, or rock or brush piles.\n\nWhen threatened, armadillos run to the nearest burrow or crevice and tightly wedge themselves inside with their back alongside the wall.  If no such burrow or shelter is available, armadillos curl up in order to protect their vulnerable underside.  Dasypus species are unable to roll into a complete ball like the Brazilian three-banded armadillo due their excessive number of dermal plates.\n\nBecause they lack significant hair covering, armadillos are particularly sensitive to climate and are therefore most active during summer nights and winter days.  Due to their low fat storage, they spend most of their activity foraging for food, which primarily consists of insects, small reptiles and amphibians, and plants.  Armadillos have a small, flattened skull with a long lower jaw and narrow snout.  They do have small, rudimentary teeth, but lack incisors, canines, and enamel.  Their tongue is particularly long and sticky and is used to forage for ants and termites.  They have very poor eyesight and instead rely on their keen sense of smell and enhanced hearing to locate buried insects and detect predators.\n\nArmadillos are fully capable of climbing, swimming, and jumping.  Dasypus have a unique ability to build up an oxygen debt and hold their breath for up to six minutes.  This allows them to cross streams and ponds underwater by simply walking or running along the bottom.  If the water body is too large for this, Dasypus can instead gulp in air, inflating their stomachs and intestines and increasing buoyancy.  This allows them to float and more easily swim across the water.\n\nDasypus are non-territorial, have large progeny, have few predators, and are capable of living in various environments, thus accounting for their large distribution. They are, though, limited by a lack of sufficient insects as a food source and their low metabolic rate, which prevents them from living in cold climates. Dasypus originated from South America but has expanded and diversified across numerous countries. The existence of human developments and construction has generally increased the armadillo's ability to expand by facilitating the crossing of previous obstacles. As of 2011, within the United States, they have not yet migrated south due to the lack of rainfall or water availability.\n\nCladogram of living Dasypus\n\nD. kappleri\n\nD. septemcinctus\n\nD. hybridus\n\nD. mazzai\n\nD. sabanicola\n\nD. novemcinctus\n\nD. pilosus\n\nThere are currently seven recognized extant Dasypus species:\n\nAn additional Dasypus species that is of medium size with noticeably shorter ears and tail is speculated to exist in Paraguay.\n\nArmadillos are most often found in shady forest and brush areas in temperate regions.  They thrive in high rainfall habitats most likely due to better soil conditions for burrowing and a higher abundance of food.  They are also known to inhabit various other environments ranging from grassland to swamp areas and are able to adapt to numerous regions as long as adequate food and water are available.  It has been noted that armadillo species are extremely fond of water and will not only use streams for feeding and drinking but also for mud baths.\n\nMost Dasypus species are sensitive to temperature due to poor insulation.  Because of this, they currently are not found in regions with temperatures below -2 degrees Celsius or 24 annual freeze-over days.  They are, however, able to withstand short cold periods by remaining in their burrows.\n\nArmadillo's burrow systems may be up to ten meters in length and two meter deep and are complex systems with a conjoined central den.  Armadillos are known to have as many as twelve burrow sites and multiple entrances for each.  They often have a primary burrow for nesting and additional shallow burrows within their territory as food traps.  In certain coastal prairies, armadillos dig additional burrows for flood protection.  Armadillos have been documented to occasionally share burrows with other animals such as rabbits or skunks.  However, they very rarely share their burrow with another armadillo except during the mating season.  One such incidence of adult armadillos sharing burrows is during extreme cold weather, in which sharing may enhance thermoregulation.\n\nDasypus are typically non-aggressive, solitary animals.  They are, however, known to occasionally show slight aggressive behavior during the mating season or while a female is nursing.  Such behavior often includes kicking or chasing and does not cause substantial injury.  Armadillos are more likely to respond to threats by freezing, jumping into the air, or sprinting away.\n\nArmadillos use olfaction as their main perception for foraging.  The nine-banded armadillos are capable of smelling food as much as 20 cm below the ground surface.  Once a food item is detected, it digs a small hole using its forefeet.  Armadillos are also known to stand on their hind legs using their tail to brace themselves and sniff the air to either locate food or orient themselves.\n\nBecause of armadillos’ low body temperature, scavenging habits, and damp living environments they are susceptible to certain infections and parasites.  Some of these include the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, which is the causative of leprosy, the organism Trypanosoma cruzi, which is the causative of Chagas’ disease, and the fungus Paracoccidiodies brasiliensis, which is the causative of mycosis in humans.  Despite these predispositions, however, armadillos are still considered less prone to get parasites than other common small mammals such as skunks, opossums, and raccoons.  No diagnosis of rabies within Dasypus species in Florida has been recorded yet.\n\nIn some locations in Florida, Dasypus have more recently been noted to raid and destroy sea turtle nests, specifically those belonging to the endangered leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the green (Chelonia mydas).  This accounts for 95% of nest raids in the area and may present a large invasive problem.  In order to protect the endangered sea turtles, National Wildlife Refuge staff and the USDA Wildlife Services have actively trapped and removed armadillos from nesting locations.  However, though the growth of armadillos in Florida may be contributing to sea turtle invasion, they are also serving as an important primary food source to maintain the endangered Florida panther (F. concolor coryi).\n\nArmadillos have a life expectancy of 7 to 20 years.  Juveniles lack fully developed and strengthened armor and are much more susceptible to predation, thereby having a much higher mortality rate than adults.  Adult armadillos, however, have shown a significant increase in physical damage compared to juveniles.  Since juvenile mortality rates are much higher, this most likely indicates an increased ability of adults to escape from predators.  Strangely, various physical damages caused to armadillos do not appear to have any significant consequences in breeding or other physical functions.  In captivity, armadillos have a much higher life expectancy, with one recorded D. novemcinctus species living 23 years.\n\nOne of the largest causes of death of armadillos within North America are highway accidents.  This is most likely due to their common response of jumping into the air when startled which causes a direct collision with a passing automobile.  Armadillos are also killed by dogs or coyotes as well as hunted by humans as a food source.  Despite hunting, predation, and highway accidents, the IUCN lists the majority of Dasypus species as a least concern endangered animal due to its very large distribution, living tolerance, and large progeny and population.  A few species are considered at risk due to habitat loss.\n\nMost Dasypus are opportunistic feeders.  They are insectivores to omnivores but are also known to eat small vertebrates.  A study conducted on the nine-banded armadillo's stomach content concluded that their diet consists of approximately 7% plant matter and 93% animal matter.  Plants include fruit, seeds, mushroom and fungi and animal matter includes beetles, snails, ants, worms, reptiles, and amphibians.  They also occasionally eat small mammals, bird eggs, and carrion.  However, it is believed that carrion is more readily eaten for the maggots and fly pupae within.  Armadillos swallow their food with small soil particles and usually avoid chewing altogether.\n\nArmadillos of the genus Dasypus often pair during the breeding season, whereas they are usually solitary animals.  While pairing, the male and female intermittently interact while foraging.  These interactions include tail wagging, dorsal touching, sniffing, and tail lifting of the female.\n\nFemales have an external clitoris and a urogenital sinus, which acts as both a urethra and vagina. Males are slightly larger than females in size and have testes that descend into the pelvis and a prominent penis.  They lack a scrotum.  In order to copulate, the female has to lie on her back due to the high amount of bony armor and the ventrally located genitalia.\n\nAfter conception, there is a fourteen-week period before the blastocyst is actually implanted.  The blastocyst is fully developed and remains healthy through oxygen and nutrients received from uterine secretions during this time.  Gestation is about five months long, and the implantation delay allows the armadillos to give birth at a more opportune time during the spring.\n\nMembers of Dasypus are unique among mammals in possessing the reproductive trait of monozygotic polyembryony, meaning their offspring are genetically identical due to the division of a single fertilized egg into four matching embryos. This development of identical quadruplets has been utilized as a tool for genetic research.  It is possible that the monozygotic polyembryony was an adaptation to accommodate for the female's inability to carry more than one egg during the preimplantation stage.  Delaying the implantation further has no effect on the number of offspring produced.\n\nThe armadillo young are fully developed at birth.  Their eyes are already open, and they are capable of walking after a few hours.  However, the skin takes a few weeks to harden.  The baby armadillos nurse for two months and by month three or four, they are completely independent.  Young armadillos have been noted to occasionally share burrows with siblings during their first summer and fall.  Armadillos born in the spring are able to breed during the very next season the following summer.\n\nLeprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae.  M. leprae is unculturable on artificial media, and only after years of research was the ability to culture the bacteria on the footpads of mice discovered.  However, the development of the bacteria and study was still very limited until the successful infection of lepromatous leprosy in the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) by Kirchheimer and Storrs in 1971.  Soon after, Convit and Pinardi incurred a second successful inoculation of M. leprae into Dasypus sabanicola.  The armadillo became the only known animal other than primates to regularly develop leprosy and has since largely advanced the disease study through use of in vivo propagation of M. leprae.  Dasypus was also an ideal model due to the ability to replicate experiments on their genetically identical siblings.  Despite the discovery of additional Dasypus species capable of infection (D. septemcinctus  and D. pilosus), the nine-banded armadillo remains a favored animal model due to its availability and ideal body temperatures for bacterial hosting.  D. sabanicola is also continually used in research due to its adaptability to the lab environment and ease of handling.  The nine-banded armadillo's enhanced ability to grow M. leprae has led to suggestions that armadillo species are more susceptible to the disease due to their generally lower body temperatures.\n\nWhile temperature enhances susceptibility, the actual infection source and mode of transmission are very poorly understood.  This is primarily due to the bacteria's slow multiplication rate and long incubation period, making specific infection period identification difficult.  The incubation period itself may range from ten months to four years in the nine-banded armadillo, compared to three to six years in humans.  The long life of armadillos is particularly useful in the study of chronic effects of leprosy as well as the propagation of M. leprae outside of humans.  The armadillo model has been useful for biochemical, immunological, and vaccine research.\n\nThough the majority of nine-banded armadillos contract leprosy, about 15% of the species have been found to be resistant.  The resistant specimens are used as a study model in order to develop a possible genetic linkage.",

It is found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific, frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of 62 m (203 ft). Adult zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance, with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length, and usually a pattern of dark spots on a pale background. Young zebra sharks under 50–90 cm (20–35 in) long have a completely different pattern, consisting of light vertical stripes on a brown background, and lack the ridges. This species attains a length of 2.5 m (8.2 ft).\n\nZebra sharks are nocturnal and spend most of the day resting motionless on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.",

      "sections":"The zebra shark was first described as Squalus varius by Seba in 1758 (Seba died years earlier; the publication was posthumous). No type specimen was designated, though Seba included a comprehensive description in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile. Müller and Henle placed this species in the genus Stegostoma in 1837, using the specific epithet fasciatus (or the neuter form fasciatum, as Stegostoma is neuter while Squalus is masculine) from an 1801 work by Bloch and Schneider. In 1984, Compagno rejected the name \"varius/m\" in favor of \"fasciatus/m\" for the zebra shark, because Seba did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in his species descriptions (though Squalus varius is one that can be construed as a binomial name). In Compagno's view, the first proper usage of \"varius/m\" was by Garman in 1913, making it a junior synonym. Both S. fasciatum and S. varium are currently in usage for this species; until the early 1990s most authorities used the latter name, but since then most have followed Compagno and used the former name. A taxonomic review in 2019 instead argued that S. tigrinum is its valid name. This name was omitted in Compagno's review in 1984, possibly due to confusion over its year of description (in a publication in 1941, Fowler mistakenly listed it as being described in 1795). Squalus tigrinus was described by Forster in 1781, two years before Squalus fasciatus was described by Hermann. Consequently, the former and older is the valid name (as Stegostoma tigrinum), while the latter and younger is its junior synonym. As the name proposed by Forster in 1781 has been used in tens of publications since 1899, it is not a nomen oblitum.\n\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek stego meaning \"covered\", and stoma meaning \"mouth\". The specific epithet fasciatum means \"banded\", referring to the striped pattern of the juvenile. The juvenile coloration is also the origin of the common name \"zebra shark\". The name \"leopard shark\" is sometimes applied to the spotted adult, but that name usually refers to the houndshark Triakis semifasciata, and is also sometimes used for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Due to their different color patterns and body proportions, both juveniles and subadults have historically been described as separate species (Squalus tigrinus and S. longicaudatus respectively).\n\nThere is robust morphological support for the placement of the zebra shark, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of the zebra shark, and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed the zebra shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma.\n\nThe zebra shark has a cylindrical body with a large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed on the sides of the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 28–33 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 22–32 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.\n\nThere are five distinctive ridges running along the body in adults, one along the dorsal midline and two on the sides. The dorsal midline ridge merges into the first dorsal fin, placed about halfway along the body and twice the size of the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are large and broad; the pelvic and anal fins are much smaller but larger than the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin is almost as long as the rest of the body, with a barely developed lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The zebra shark attains a length of 2.5 m (8.2 ft), with an unsubstantiated record of 3.5 m (11 ft). Males and females are not dimorphic in size.\n\nThe color pattern in young sharks is dark brown above and light yellow below, with vertical yellow stripes and spots. As the shark grows to 50–90 cm (20–35 in) long, the dark areas begin to break up, changing the general pattern from light-on-dark stripes to dark-on-light spots. There is substantial variation in pattern amongst adults, which can be used to identify particular individuals. A rare morph, informally called the sandy zebra shark, is overall sandy–brown in color with inconspicuous dark brown freckles on its upperside, lacking the distinct dark-spotted and banded pattern typical of the species. The appearance of juveniles of this morph is unknown, but subadults that are transitioning into adult sandy zebra sharks have a brown-netted pattern. Faint remnants of this pattern can often be seen in adult sandy zebra sharks. This morph, which is genetically inseparable from the normal morph, is only known from the vicinity of Malindi in Kenya, although seemingly similar individuals have been reported from Japan and northwestern Australia.\n\nIn 1964, a partially albino zebra shark was discovered in the Indian Ocean. It was overall white and completely lacked spots, but its eyes were blackish-brown as typical of the species and unlike full albinos. The shark, a 1.9 m (6.2 ft) long mature female, was unusual in that albino animals rarely survive long in the wild due to their lack of crypsis.\n\nThe zebra shark occurs in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from South Africa to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (including Madagascar and the Maldives), to India and Southeast Asia (including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Palau), northward to Taiwan and Japan, eastward to New Caledonia and Tonga, and southward to northern Australia.\n\nBottom-dwelling in nature, the zebra shark is found from the intertidal zone to a depth of 62 m (203 ft) over the continental and insular shelves. Adults and large juveniles frequent coral reefs, rubble, and sandy areas. There are unsubstantiated reports of this species from fresh water in the Philippines. Zebra sharks sometimes cross oceanic waters to reach isolated seamounts. Movements of up to 140 km (87 mi) have been recorded for individual sharks. However, genetic data indicates that there is little exchange between populations of zebra sharks, even if their ranges are contiguous.\n\nDuring the day, zebra sharks are sluggish and usually found resting on the sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins to prop up the front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.\n\nThe zebra shark feeds primarily on shelled molluscs, though it also takes crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes (notably other larger sharks) and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.\n\nZebra sharks are usually solitary, though aggregations of 20–50 individuals have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations of several hundred zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors between male and female sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.\n\nThe courtship behavior of the zebra shark consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail, with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom. On occasion this leads to mating, in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for two to five minutes. The zebra shark is oviparous, with females laying large egg capsules measuring 17 cm (6.7 in) long, 8 cm (3.1 in) wide, and 5 cm (2.0 in) thick. The egg case is dark brown to purple in color, and has hair-like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate. The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female's vent; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers, so as to anchor the eggs. Females have been documented laying up to 46 eggs over a 112-day period. Eggs are deposited in batches of around four. Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown.\n\nIn captivity, the eggs hatch after four to six months, depending on temperature. The hatchlings measure 20–36 cm (7.9–14.2 in) long and have proportionately longer tails than adults. The habitat preferences of juveniles are unclear; one report places them at depths greater than 50 m (160 ft), while another report from India suggests they inhabit shallower water than adults. The stripes of the juveniles may have an anti-predator function, making each individual in a group harder to target. Males attain sexual maturity at 1.5–1.8 m (4.9–5.9 ft) long, and females at 1.7 m (5.6 ft) long. Their lifespan has been estimated to be 25–30 years in the wild. There have been two reports of female zebra sharks producing young asexually. An additional study has observed parthenogenesis in females regardless of sexual history.\n\nDocile and slow-moving, zebra sharks are not dangerous to humans and can be easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed to the presence of humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.\n\nThe zebra shark is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat and low levels of dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the IUCN Red List has this species categorized as Endangered . Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe Santa Catalina rattlesnake (Crotalus catalinensis) is a species of pit viper endemic to Isla Santa Catalina in the Gulf of California just off the east coast of the state of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Like all other pit vipers, it is venomous. No subspecies are currently recognized. A relatively small and slender species, its most distinctive characteristic is that it lacks a rattle. They are also a generally nocturnal species. Though the species is classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, there are few efforts for the snake's conservation.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"This species is relatively slender and stunted, growing to a maximum of 73.1 cm (2 ft 4.8 in) in length.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of this snake is its lack of a rattle. The base of the tail, the \"button\", has degenerated to such an extent that the rattle immediately falls off with each shed instead of forming a new segment, as it does in other species of rattlesnakes. This is widely believed to be a localized adaptation, as the rattle becomes a liability rather than an asset while hunting. The lack of any large predators or hoofed mammals in its natural locale has also played a factor in making the rattle redundant. It appears that Crotalus catalinensis may not be alone in feeling these selective pressures, as red diamond rattlesnakes on the island of San Lorenzo Sur and San Esteban island black-tailed rattlesnakes also appear to be losing their rattles. Notably, it appears that this phenomenon is confined to populations limited to islands in the Gulf of California.\n\nNatural selection has also given this snake a more elongated body than featured in related mainland forms, and measurably longer teeth; These are both characteristics associated with snakes that hunt in trees and shrubs such as this species. This species also lacks the standard bite-and-release tactic employed by usual rattlesnakes, preferring to instead hold prey in its jaws until the venom can take effect. In this way, it avoids the possibility that prey might fall out or fly away prior to succumbing.\n\nOf the two distinct color variations, the predominant variant has a light cream-colored base, with reddish-brown blotching down the back, and black and white banding around the tail. The other variant has a much lighter, ash gray color, with darker gray blotching. The banding around the tail is still present. The banding tapers off and becomes more obscure. The two different colors were originally thought to be due to natural selection and therefore match different habitat backgrounds, but that has not been supported. There is no difference between the brown and grey within the habitat, as well as no difference in the frequency of color between males and females. However, evidence suggests that the darker coloration on the snakes make them more easily adaptable because of their ability to bask and absorb more heat. This causes their metabolism to speed up which provides them with faster digestion that helps increase strength and physical conditions. Due to these factors, the darker colored snakes have greater reproductive success than the lighter colored snakes. Though the dark snakes have these advantages, their coloration comes at a cost because they are more easily spotted by predators than the sand colored snakes.\n\nThis snake is found only on Isla Santa Catalina in the Gulf of California off the coast of southern Baja California. This island is also the type locality for the species. The island is fairly small, being only 43 square kilometers (17 sq mi).\n\nThis species is classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List with the following criteria: B1ab(v) (v3.1, 2001). This means that the best available evidence indicates it is considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild because its geographic range is estimated to be less than 100 km2 (39 sq mi), it exists at only a single location, and a continuing decline has been observed, inferred, or projected in the number of mature individuals. It was assessed in 2007.\n\nIt is threatened due to collecting and the introduction of alien predator species, such as domestic cats. This population of cats formerly invaded the island and have since been eradicated in 2002. There is no guarantee that the cats will not be reintroduced into the area, which could cause problems for the snake, whether that be from being preyed on themselves or through the population decline of their main food sources. The presence of these cats have negatively affected many populations of several other island reptile species.\n\nBecause the rattlesnake has such limited options for prey on the island, it is vital to maintain the populations of prey for the conservation of C. catalinensis, especially because the main species of prey for the snake, Peromyscus slevini, is endemic to the island.\n\nOther threats include human influence such as killing out of fear and capturing for the illegal collection of rare wildlife. Because the Santa Catalina rattlesnake is an endemic species, and is without a rattle, the snake is more valued and therefore more threatened. Climate also impacts the Santa Catalina by influencing plant productivity which is mostly related to the vast differences in the quantity of rainfall. Environmental temperature fluctuations due to climate change affects the snakes because they are ectotherms- the outside temperature directly influences the snake's body temperature.\n\nThere are currently no movements towards the conservation of this species. Bahía de Loreto National Park considered the rattlesnake as \"very difficult to observe\" which adds to the lack of conservation efforts. Because this species is endemic to the island and the territory is fairly small, the area being  40.99 km2, the snakes are faced with possible inbreeding, demographic and environmental stochasticity, and more. However, there are no studies, as of 2005, to support these speculations.\n\nEach of these threats, along with the species' biological characteristics of late maturation, slow growth, few offspring and long periods of time between each breeding period, contributes to the vulnerability of the species. Conservation efforts for the habitats of Santa Catalina Island as well as the prey of C. catalinensis would improve the rattlesnake's risk of extinction.\n\nThe habitat on Santa Catalina Island consists of Gulf Coast desert plants. This snake is often found on the western side of the island within the many arroyos. The Santa Catalina rattlesnake is also found in plains, bottoms of ravines, and riverbeds of streams. They are found on summits of rocky hills where they often find shelter in the rock crevices. One of the main shelter options is dense vegetation which can also be used as an efficient way to find prey. It is believed that the snakes find shelter in the vegetation to help maintain a constant body temperature as well as use the density to hide from predators.\n\nWhile most members of this genus, Crotalus, are almost entirely terrestrial due to their heavy body structure, this species' small size makes it a swift and skillful climber. Previous researchers hypothesized that the ability of the Santa Catalina rattlesnake to climb, combined with its lack of a rattle allowed it to hunt roosting birds, but detailed research into the species’ diet has revealed that the Santa Catalina rattlesnake maintains a mammal-based diet like most rattlesnakes. Further inquiry into the arboreal behavior of this island species has shown individuals actually spend the majority of their time on the ground. Individuals were most likely to be found in low branches of bushes during July, the hottest month on the island. The Santa Catalina rattlesnake is thought to climb off of the hot ground and into bushes to thermoregulate. The snake expresses thermo-conformist behavior which means that its body temperature correlates with soil temperature. This is a common trait among other rattlesnakes.\n\nUnlike most species of rattlesnakes, the Santa Catalina rattlesnake is often observed exposed; it does not tend to hide. Currently, the greater evidence supports the theory that the Santa Catalina rattlesnake has evolved away from having a rattle because it has no need for a warning mechanism against predators.\n\nThough it was previously thought that the snakes presented diurnal and nocturnal habits, more evidence suggests that they are completely nocturnal, even during winter months. The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake does not hibernate.\n\nPrevious theories  suggested the tendency for this rattlesnake to climb into low bushes was connected to a dietary shift toward consuming birds. However, studies conducted from 2002 to 2004 revealed that stomach and fecal contents were 70% mammal (Santa Catalina deer mouse,  Peromyscus slevini) and 30% lizard species (Santa Catalina desert iguana, Dipsosaurus catalinensis; Santa Catalina side-blotched lizard, Uta squamata; and Sceloporus lineatulus.) “We found no bird remains in scats or stomach contents of C. catalinensis in any year or season.”\n\nThe diet of this rattlesnake is a fraction of the diet of its closest relative, the Red diamond rattlesnake, Crotalus ruber. C. ruber, like most rattlesnakes, frequently prey on lizards and small mammals such as mice, rats, and squirrels. C. ruber also is known to eat frogs, toads, birds, and other snakes. The restricted diet of the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake compared to its sister species is likely due to the limited prey diversity on the island. Small body size in the Santa Catalina rattlesnake may be an evolutionary response to their reliance on small-sized prey. For example, the main prey is the endemic Santa Catalina Deer Mouse, Peromyscus slevini, which are measured to 21 cm (8.3 in) in total length including the tail, which is 10 centimeters (3.9 in).\n\nLike other rattlesnake species from central and northern Mexico, the Santa Catalina rattlesnake has greater foraging activity during the summer and rainy season (July–October).\n\nLaurence Klauber (1972) suggested this species is closely related to C. scutulatus. However, a later study by Murphy and Crabtree (1985) used allozyme data to conclude the Santa Catalina rattlesnake shares its most recent ancestor with C. ruber. Most of the morphological, biogeographic, and biochemical data suggest the same.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus) also known as the gray-brown mouse lemur or rufous-gray mouse lemur, is a small, solitary-but-social, nocturnal and omnivorous primate from the Western Madagascar in the region around Beza Mahafaly Reserve, north to Lamboharana. Like the other lemur species, the reddish-grey mouse lemur is endemic to Madagascar. They generally live in the drier regions of the island. It is categorized as least concerned in the IUCN Red List.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Microcebus griseorufus has a pelage color that is alternating light neutral gray, pale neutral gray, and light pale neutral gray dorsally and ventrally light grayish-white on the anterior two-thirds and bicolored light grayish-white and pale neutral gray on the posterior one-third. It has a cinnamon colored dorsal stripe running from the crown of the head or the shoulders to the end of the tail. The head of this species has a pale neutral gray spot above the nose, cinnamon around the eyes, a clay colored crown, and ears that are light neutral gray. The dorsal side of the tail is cinnamon colored while the ventral side is grayish-beige on the most distal two-thirds and cinnamon with faint brownish black streaks on the proximal one-third. The hands and feet are colored grayish-white and the vibrissae are dark in color. This species has a relatively robust skull. The size of the reddish-gray brown mouse lemur ranges from 25 to about 28 cm (9.8 to about 11.0 in), while their mass can range between 46 and 79 g (1.6 and 2.8 oz). It is assumed that like other nocturnal species, the reddish-gray mouse lemur has very sensitive ears, making them important for communication, social encounters, predator avoidance, and critter finding.\n\nWith differences in fur color so broad that by appearance alone, individuals have been mistaken as different species in the past. Despite their strikingly different appearance, these reddish-gray mouse lemur may, in fact, not be so different genetically and belong to the same species. Habitat type and factors, and genetic distance have both been found to be uncorrelated to the different pelage, and thus, they have little to not impact on the fur color of the individuals.\n\nEven though their perception of color is different from human beings, vision is still important to the reddish-gray mouse lemur as they may recognize one another from facial patterns. It also dictates their activity level and when they start coming out to start foraging (i.e. when light levels are low enough). This can affect their lifespan, reproduction, and seasonal torpor due to photoperiodism. Like many other species in their suborder, the reddish-gray mouse lemur have tapetum lucidum, a characteristic that makes it easier for them to navigate in environments with low light levels.\n\nResearch has found that the morphology of their hands and feet may vary slightly depending on the individual's habitat due to the difference in tree types. Individuals in the from the gallery forests, which have an abundance of small, flexible and high canopies, with many horizontal adjacent branches will have hook-like hands for easier locomotion. Those who live in spiny forests have hands formed like clamps for easier grasping, ground movement and vertical supports, since spiny forests have more open spaces, with large-trunked trees favoring such characteristics.\n\nThe habitats of the reddish-gray mouse lemur include the spiny forests and gallery forests, as well as the shrublands or the dry forests near the Western and Southwestern coasts of Madagascar. They are one of the few mammals to occupy these driest regions of the island. The spiny forests have harsh and unpredictable conditions, with highly variable ambient temperatures, as well as scarce food and water sources compared to the other habitat types. However, there is a lower population density in spiny forests and other more arid areas compared to more humid regions of this mouse lemur's habitat, since the quality of food they provide is lower. The species has been observed to be male dispersed.\n\nThe reddish-gray mouse lemur is an omnivore. They feed on fruits, insects, flowers, and plant exudate (i.e. gum, sap, etc.). There are variations in their diet depending on the season, environmental conditions, food availability, localities, chosen habitat, as well as their sex. Before the wet season ends, the reddish-grey mouse lemur prepares for the dry season (April-May to October) by optimizing their food intake and engage in opportunistic fattening while the food resources are higher. During the drier regions or seasons, the reddish-gray mouse lemur will consume more gums and other plant exudates than other parts of their diet, such as fruits, since they are more renewable and more readily available under these conditions. Females under the same arid conditions may consume more exudates but fewer insects than their male counterparts. Their diet may also be affected due to sleeping associations. Individuals within a sleeping group have been observed to consume more fruits and less plant exudates compared to individuals who are not associated. After observing the species in a habitat with more food availability, a research has found that the reddish-grey mouse lemur has a preference in their food, favoring fruits over plant gums or exudates, while insects are hunted at a given opportunity. Even if arthropod give more nutrients, they are not as easily found, accessible or defended than fruits and trees.\n\nLittle is known about the reproduction and parenting of the reddish-gray mouse lemur, but it is known that, much like other mouse lemurs, they are polyestrous (i.e. they have more than one estrus cycle per year) and are seasonal breeders. Their reproductive season last for a long time compared to some other species, during the wet and rainy season, which is usually between September and May. This may vary by individuals, however, as factors such as nutritional balance and quality may affect both the survival of the mother and reproductive success. A research on mouse lemur reproduction showed that estrus period seem to occur more often around October (though the number of females experiencing it may vary monthly and yearly). During the driest months, which are between May and July, females may be non-reproductive and more focused on survival than reproduction. A female may give birth to multiple offspring in a single litter. The reproduction process may also involve mate-guarding, and alloparenting in female pairs since estrus may not be synchronous, but lactation may occur simultaneously, easing alloparental care. Outside the mating season, courtship may occur through trill calls, implying that a long-term relationship prior to mating occur.\n\nThe reddish-gray mouse lemur may engage in various social interactions, such as grooming their associate or foraging near one another. Other observed behaviors include urine-washing, which have been used in the control of space (e.g. sleeping sites) and mate monopolization.\n\nThe reddish-grey mouse lemur have a dispersed social system. Like other mouse lemurs species, they have a matriarchal social organization. An example of this would be that females reddish-gray mouse lemur have been observed to have higher priority than their male counterpart when it comes to food resources, especially if they are scarce. In agonistic relationships, females were found to win more often than males by a large margin. Females also have the priority (and monopoly) on fruiting trees, and they also have more power and control over food resources, often engaging in cooperative management with fellow females. In pairs of females with young, the leading females are very often the larger and heavier ones.\n\nLike many other mouse lemurs, the reddish-grey mouse lemur is a relatively solitary animal. While they do have a social system, it is a dispersed one. Individuals rarely come into physical contact when they are active (e.g. when individuals are foraging). However, despite their mostly solitary nature, communication and social signaling between individual mouse lemur still occur through auditory and olfactory means. Trill calls are used during courtship or mating season, and sequences of short whistles are used as alarm calls. Unlike other species where social interactions can happen through visual cues (e.g. patterns or color on the fur), that may not be entirely the case for the reddish-gray mouse lemur due to the fact that the difference in fur color within the species, which is visible to human beings, is likely not visible among themselves.\n\nWhile reddish-grey mouse lemurs are mostly solitary animals, they do have sleeping associations, or sleeping groups, and are commonly formed among species of mouse lemur, including the reddish-grey mouse lemur. They may use vines, birds' nests or branches' hollows as sleeping areas. They are considered to be very safe from predators, and help in thermoregulation of the ambient temperature. The sleeping sites tend to be located near feeding trees. Associates at sleeping sites usually sleep apart, and are mostly pairs of adults; sleeping groups rarely included more than two individuals, and usually meet about an hour before dawn. Pairs may change partners at any time. The reason for these sleeping associations is not a tactic to defend against predators, but for more social reasons, such as the opportunity for higher quality diet (i.e. fruit trees), and alloparenting. During rainy seasons, sleeping associations have been observed to be a more common occurrence compared to the dry seasons.\n\nBecause of the unpredictability and challenges of their habitat, the reddish-gray mouse lemur has developed flexibility in their energy-saving tactics: torpor and prolonged hibernation. They vary in length, but many individuals may engage in either irregular and short torpors, daily torpors, longer torpors that spans over a few days, or simply hibernation lasting for a few weeks. During the dry season, many individuals undergo torpor to conserve energy, though females have been observed to undergo seasonal torpor more frequently and for longer than males. The length of the torpor, and the level of variation in thermal physiology also vary a lot between different individuals, even if they were to live in the same regions. As such, the need and extent of the torpor depend the individual's conditions prior to the torpor or the hibernation.\n\nWhile mouse lemurs as a whole has been in rapid decline, the reddish-gray mouse lemur as a species is not a particularly threatened species compared to other similar species. However, it does still face decline in numbers and decrease in habitat area and habitat quality due to deforestation related to the timber industry, as well as agriculture and aquaculture. Due to the high amount of anthropogenic disturbances occurring at their habitat, the resources the reddish-grey mouse lemur needs is often cut often. Climate change also affect their distribution greatly through desertification. Conservation efforts include the education of residents, as well as land and water protection within protected zones, including Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, the Berenty Private Reserve, Mikea and Andohahela.",

      "introduction":"\n\nA  hedgehog  is a spiny mammal of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera found throughout parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia and no living species native to the Americas. However, the extinct genus Amphechinus was once present in North America.\n\nHedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and they have changed little over the last fifteen million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Their spiny protection resembles that of porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English heyghoge, from heyg, hegge 'hedge', because it frequents hedgerows, and hoge, hogge 'hog', from its piglike snout. Another name that is used is hedgepig.\n\nHedgehogs are easily recognized by their spines, which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin. Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and, unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. This is called \"quilling\". Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress. Hedgehogs are usually brown, with pale tips to the spines, though blonde hedgehogs are found on the Channel Island of Alderney.\n\nHedgehogs roll into a tight spiny ball when threatened, tucking in the furry face, feet, and belly. The hedgehog's back contains two large muscles that direct the quills. Some light-weight desert hedgehog species with fewer spines are more likely to flee or attack, ramming an intruder with the spines, rolling up only as a last resort.\n\nHedgehogs are primarily nocturnal, with some species also active during the day. Hedgehogs sleep for a large portion of the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug underground. All wild hedgehogs can hibernate, though the duration depends on  temperature, species, and abundance of food.\n\nHedgehogs are fairly vocal, with a variety of grunts, snuffles and/or squeals.\n\nThey occasionally perform a ritual called anointing. When the animal encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its spines with its tongue. Some experts believe this might serve to camouflage the hedgehog with the local scent, and might also lead to infection of predators poked by the spines. Anointing is sometimes also called anting after a similar behavior in birds.\n\nLike opossums, mice, and moles, hedgehogs have some natural immunity against some snake venom through the protein erinacin in their muscles, though in such small amounts that a viper bite may still be fatal. In addition, hedgehogs are one of four known mammalian groups with natural protection against another snake venom, α-neurotoxin. Developing independently, pigs, honey badgers, mongooses, and hedgehogs all have mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that prevent the binding of the snake venom α-neurotoxin.\n\nThe sense of smell has been little studied in the hedgehog, as the olfactory part of the mammal brain is obscured inside the neopallium. Tests have suggested that hedgehogs share the same olfactory electrical activity as cats.\n\nAlthough traditionally classified in the abandoned order Insectivora, hedgehogs are omnivorous. They feed on insects, snails, frogs and toads, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass roots, berries, and melons. Afghan hedgehogs devour berries in early spring after hibernation.[citation needed]\nHedgehogs have been observed eating cat food left outdoors for pets, but this may not be a proper food for hedgehogs in captivity.[video:1]\n\nWhen a hedgehog hibernates, its normal 30–35 °C (86–95 °F) body temperature  decreases to 2–5 °C (36–41 °F).\n\nHedgehog gestation lasts 35–58 days, depending on species. The average litter is 3–4 newborns for larger species and 5–6 for smaller ones. As with many animals, it is not unusual for an adult male hedgehog to kill newborn males.\n\nHedgehogs have a relatively long lifespan for their size. In captivity, lack of predators and controlled diet contribute to a lifespan of 8–10 years depending on size. In the wild, larger species live 4–7 years (some recorded up to 16 years), and smaller species live 2–4 years (4–7 in captivity). This compares to a mouse at 2 years and a large rat at 3–5 years.\n\nNewborn hoglets are blind, with their quills covered by a protective membrane which dries and shrinks over several hours, and falls off after cleaning, allowing the quills to emerge.\n\nThe various species have many predators: while forest hedgehogs are prey primarily to birds (especially owls) and ferrets, smaller species like the long-eared hedgehog are prey to foxes, wolves, and mongooses. Hedgehog bones have been found in the pellets of the Eurasian eagle owl.\n\nIn Britain, the main predator is the European badger. European hedgehog populations in the United Kingdom are lower in areas with many badgers, and hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. Badgers also compete with hedgehogs for food.\n\nThe most common pet species of hedgehog are hybrids of the white-bellied hedgehog or four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) and the smaller North African hedgehog (A. algirus, pygmy hedgehog). Other species kept as pets are the long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus) and the Indian long-eared hedgehog (H. collaris).\n\nAs of 2019[update] it is illegal to own a hedgehog as a pet in four US states including Hawaii, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and California, as well as New York City, Washington, DC and some Canadian municipalities, and breeding licenses are required. No such restrictions exist in most European countries with the exception of Scandinavia. In Italy, it is illegal to keep wild hedgehogs as pets.\n\nIn areas where hedgehogs have been introduced, such as New Zealand and the islands of Scotland, the hedgehog has become a pest, lacking natural predators. In New Zealand it has decimated native species including insects, snails, lizards and ground-nesting birds, particularly shore birds.\n\nEradication can be troublesome. Attempts to eliminate hedgehogs from bird colonies on the Scottish islands of North Uist and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides were met with international protest. Eradication began in 2003 with 690 hedgehogs killed, though animal welfare groups attempted rescues. By 2007, legal injunctions prohibited the killing, and in 2008, the elimination process was changed to trapping and releasing on the mainland.\n\nIn 2022, it was reported that the hedgehog population in rural Britain was declining rapidly, down by 30%-75% since 2000.\n\nHedgehogs suffer many diseases common to mammals, including cancer, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease.\n\nCancer is very common in hedgehogs. The most common is squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads quickly from bone to the organs, unlike in humans. Surgery to remove the bone tumors is impractical.\n\nFatty liver and heart disease are believed to be caused by bad diet and obesity. Hedgehogs will eagerly eat foods high in fat and sugar, despite a metabolism adapted for low-fat, protein-rich insects.\n\nHedgehogs are also highly susceptible to pneumonia, with difficulty breathing and nasal discharge, caused by the bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica.\n\nHedgehogs uncommonly transmit a fungal ringworm or dermatophytosis skin infection to human handlers and other hedgehogs, caused by Trichophyton erinacei, a distinct mating group among the Arthroderma benhamiae fungi.\n\nHedgehogs can suffer from balloon syndrome, a rare condition in which gas is trapped under the skin from injury or infection, causing the animal to inflate. The condition is unique to hedgehogs because their skin is baggy enough to curl up. In 2017 the BBC reported a case of a male hedgehog \"almost twice its natural size, literally blown up like a beach ball with incredibly taut skin\". At Stapeley's Wildlife Hospital, vet Bev Panto, said, \"I have seen three or four of these cases and they are very strange every time and quite shocking ... When you first see them they appear to be very big hedgehogs but when you pick them up they feel so light because they are mostly air\". The British Hedgehog Preservation Society advises:\n\nThere is no single cause for this condition. The air can be removed by incising or aspirating through the skin over the back. Antibiotic cover should be given. This may be associated with lung/chest wall damage or a small external wound acting like a valve or a clostridium type infection.\n\nAs with most small mammals living around humans, many are run over as they attempt to cross roadways. In Ireland, hedgehogs are one of the most common mammalian road fatalities. Between April 2008 and November 2010 on two stretches of road measuring 227 km and 32.5 km there were 133 recorded hedgehog fatalities. Of another 135 hedgehog carcasses collected from throughout Ireland, there were significantly more males than females collected, with peaks in male deaths occurring in May and June. Female deaths outnumbered males only in August, with further peaks in female deaths observed in June and July. It is suggested that these peaks are related to the breeding season (adults) and dispersal/exploration following independence.\n\nDomesticated hedgehogs can get their heads stuck in tubes such as toilet paper tubes, and walk around with them. Some owners call this \"tubing\" and promote the behavior, providing a tube cut lengthwise to allow the hedgehog to remove it. Some hedgehogs intentionally wear tubes for hours.\n\nHedgehogs are a food source in many cultures. They were eaten in Ancient Egypt and some recipes of the Late Middle Ages call for hedgehog meat. They are traded throughout Eurasia and Africa for traditional medicine and witchcraft. In the Middle East and especially among Bedouins, hedgehog meat is considered medicine against  rheumatism and arthritis. Hedgehogs are also said to cure a variety of disorders from tuberculosis to impotence. In Morocco, inhaling the smoke of the burnt skin or bristles supposedly remedies fever, impotence, and urinary illnesses; the blood is sold as a cure for ringworm, cracked skin and warts, and the flesh is eaten as a remedy for witchcraft. Romani people still eat hedgehogs, boiled or roasted, and also use the blood and the fat as a medicine.\n\nIn 1981, British publican Philip Lewis developed a line of Hedgehog Flavoured Crisps, whose taste was apparently based on the flavourings used by Romani to bake hedgehogs. As they did not contain any actual hedgehog product, the Office of Fair Trading ordered him to change the name to Hedgehog Flavour Crisps.\n\nSubfamily Erinaceinae (hedgehogs)\n\nIn worldwide folklore, hedgehogs are associated with intelligence and wisdom (Asia, Europe), and magic (Africa).",

It is commonly found under rocks, logs and leaf litter in various forest, woodland and shrubland communities where it forages for small invertebrates. During cool sunny weather the lizards are found to occupy exposed patches of leaf litter as a form of temperature regulation and when temperatures become hot they are often found in shaded environments or around the base of low vegetation.\n\nLerista timida are oviparous reptiles with the females producing a single clutch of two eggs in late spring.\n\nLerista timida is listed as endangered in Victoria due to the extent of development in its preferred habitat   and of least concern in QLD, NSW, SA and NT but it is still subjectable to general threats such as habitat loss from land clearing, habitat degradation by introduced species such as cattle and sheep, global warming, feral predators such as dogs, cats, pigs, foxes, road deaths and emerging diseases.[citation needed]\n\nThe family Scincidae has bodies that are elongated and flattened with shortened or removed limbs and digits allowing them to easily penetrate soil allowing them to dwell beneath the ground. These fossorial habits may have formed due to an increase in seasonally dry and arid habitats resulting in the emergence of the Lerista genus.

It lives an entirely aquatic lifestyle in parts of North America in lakes, rivers, and ponds. It goes through paedomorphosis and retains its external gills. Because skin and lung respiration alone is not sufficient for gas exchange, the common mudpuppy must rely on external gills as its primary means of gas exchange. It is usually a rusty brown color and can grow to an average total length (including tail) of 13 in (330 mm). It is a nocturnal creature, and is active during the day only if the water in which it lives is murky. Its diet consists of almost anything it can get into its mouth, including insects, mollusks, and earthworms (as well as other annelids). Once a female common mudpuppy reaches sexual maturity at six years of age, she can lay an average of 60 eggs. In the wild, the average lifespan of a common mudpuppy is 11 years.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The common mudpuppy can be a rusty brown color with gray and black and usually has blackish-blue spots, but some albino adults have been reported in Arkansas. In clear, light water, their skin gets darker, likewise in darker water, their skin gets lighter in color. At sexual maturity, mudpuppies can be 20 cm (8 in) long and continue to grow to an average length of 33 cm (13 in), though specimens up to 43.5 cm (17.1 in) have been reported. Their external gills resemble ostrich plumes and their size depends on the oxygen levels present in the water. In stagnant water, mudpuppies have larger gills, whereas in running streams where oxygen is more prevalent, they have smaller gills. The distal portions of the gills are very filamentous and contain many capillaries. Mudpuppies also have small, flattened limbs which can be used for slowly walking on the bottoms of streams or ponds, or they can be flattened against the body during short swimming spurts. They have mucous glands which provide a slimy protective coating \n\nMudpuppies are one of many species of salamanders that fail to undergo metamorphosis. Most hypotheses surrounding the origin of Necturus's lack of metamorphosis concern the effectiveness of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland in some salamanders, like the axolotl, produce normal thyroid hormones (THs), but cells in the organism express thyroid hormone receptors (TR) that are mutated, and do not bond correctly with thyroid hormones, leading to some salamanders in a state of perpetual juvenile-hood. In contrast to axolotls, in mudpuppies, these THs are normally expressed. However, it is believed that instead of having TH-insensitive tissues that block the effects of THs, some mudpuppy tissues, such as the external gills, have lost the ability to be regulated by TH over time. This selective insensitivity to THs suggests a normal level of activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis in developing mudpuppies, unlike other salamander species.\n\nThe common mudpuppy also does not have a parathyroid gland. The majority of salamanders with parathyroid glands rely on them to help with hypercalcemic regulation; hypercalcemic regulation in mudpuppies is primarily done by the pituitary gland instead. In common mudpuppies, the purpose of the absence of a parathyroid gland is poorly understood. One reason for the absence might be the lack of variability in the climate of mudpuppies, as the parathyroid glands of salamanders vary greatly depending on seasonal changes, or whether the organism hibernates.\n\nNecturus maculosus specimens live in streams, lakes, and ponds in the eastern part of North America. They appear in the southern section of Canada, as far south as Georgia, and from the Midwest United States to North Carolina. Behaviorally, they hide under cover such as rocks and logs during the day and become more active at night. However, in muddy waters, the mudpuppy may become active during the day. Mudpuppies can even live under the ice when lakes freeze.\nThere is an introduced population in Maine.\n\nMudpuppies use rows of teeth to eat their prey. Salamanders have three different sets of teeth: dentary, premaxillary, and vomerine teeth, which are named due to their location in the mouth. All the teeth, despite their different locations, are very similar. They are small and conical, meaning mudpuppies are homodonts due to their similar shape. The common mudpuppy never leaves its aquatic environment and therefore does not undergo morphogenesis; however, many salamanders do and develop differentiated teeth. Aquatic salamander teeth are used to hinder escape of the prey from the salamander; they do not have a crushing function. This aids the salamander when feeding. When the salamander performs the \"suck and gape\" feeding style, the prey is pulled into the mouth, and the teeth function to hold the prey inside the mouth and prevent the prey from escaping. At both sides of their mouths their lips interlock, which allows them to use suction feeding. They are carnivorous creatures and will eat almost anything they can get into their mouths. Typically they prey upon animals such as insects and their larvae, mollusks, annelids, crayfish, small fish, amphibians, earthworms, and spiders. The jaw of a mudpuppy also plays a significant role in its diet. The mudpuppy jaw is considered metaautostyly, like most amphibians, meaning the jaw is more stable and that the salamander has a dentary. This affects their diet by limiting the flexibility of the jaw to take in larger prey. The mudpuppy has few predators which may include fish, crayfish, turtles, and water snakes. Fishermen also frequently catch and discard them.\n\nMudpuppies take six years to reach sexual maturity. Mating typically takes place in autumn, though eggs are not laid till much later. When males are ready to breed, their cloacae become swollen. Males deposit their spermatophores in the substratum of the environment. The female will then pick them up with her cloaca and store them in a small specialized gland, a spermatheca, until the eggs are fertilized. Females store the sperm until ovulation and internal fertilization take place, usually just prior to deposition in the spring. Before the eggs are deposited, male mudpuppies leave the nest. Once ready, the female deposits the eggs in a safe location, usually on the underside of a rock or log. They can lay from 20 to 200 eggs, usually an average of 60. The eggs are not pigmented and are about 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) mm in diameter. The female stays with her eggs during the incubation period (around 40 days). Hatchlings are about 2.5 cm (0.98 in) long and grow to 3.6 cm (1.4 in) before the yolk is completely consumed.\n\nThree subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.\n\nNota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Necturus.",

Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open, dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.). Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting during dusk and dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The burrowing owl was formally described by Spanish naturalist Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782 under the binomial name Strix cunicularia from a specimen collected in Chile. The specific epithet is from the Latin cunicularius meaning \"burrower\" or \"miner\". The burrowing owl is now placed in the genus Athene that was introduced by German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822.\n\nThe burrowing owl is sometimes classified in the monotypic genus Speotyto based on an overall different morphology and karyotype. Osteology and DNA sequence data, though, suggest that the burrowing owl is a terrestrial member of the little owls (Athene), and it is today placed in that genus by most authorities.\n\nA considerable number of subspecies have been described, but they differ little in appearance and the taxonomy of several of them needs to be validated. Most subspecies are found in/near the Andes and in the Antilles. Although distinct from each other, the relationship of the Florida subspecies to (and its distinctness from) the Caribbean birds is not quite clear.\n\nThe 18 recognised subspecies, of which two are now extinct, are:\n\nincludes A. c. partridgei (Olrog, 1976): Corrientes burrowing owl – Corrientes Province, Argentina, probably not distinct from A. c. cunicularia\n\nA paleosubspecies, A. c. providentiae, has been described from fossil remains from the Pleistocene of the Bahamas. How these birds relate to the extant A. c. floridana – that is, whether they were among the ancestors of that subspecies, or whether they represented a more distant lineage that completely disappeared later – is unknown.\n\nIn addition, prehistoric fossils of similar owls have been recovered from many islands in the Caribbean (Barbuda, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Mona Island and Puerto Rico). These birds became extinct towards the end of the Pleistocene, probably because of ecological and sea-level changes at the end of the last ice age rather than human activity. These fossil owls differed in size from present-day burrowing owls and their relationship to the modern taxon has not been resolved.\n\nBurrowing owls have bright eyes; their beaks can be dark yellow or gray depending on the subspecies. They lack ear tufts and have a flattened facial disc. The owls have prominent white eyebrows and a white \"chin\" patch which they expand and display during certain behaviors, such as a bobbing of the head when agitated.\n\nAdults have brown heads and wings with white spotting. Their chests and abdomens are white with variable brown spotting or barring, also depending on the subspecies. Juvenile owls are similar in appearance, but they lack most of the white spotting above and brown barring below. The juveniles have a buff bar across their upper wings and their breasts may be buff-colored rather than white. Burrowing owls of all ages have grayish legs longer than those of other owls.\n\nMales and females are similar in size and appearance, so display little sexual dimorphism. Females tend to be heavier, but males tend to have longer linear measurements (wing length, tail length, etc.). Adult males appear lighter in color than females because they spend more time outside the burrow during daylight, and their feathers become \"sun-bleached\". The burrowing owl measures 19–28 cm (7–11 in) long and spans 50.8–61 cm (20–24 in) across the wings, and weighs 140–240 g (5–8 oz). As a size comparison, an average adult is slightly larger than an American robin (Turdus migratorius).[failed verification]\n\nBefore European colonization, burrowing owls probably inhabited every suitable area of the New World, but in North America, they have experienced some restrictions in distribution since then. In parts of South America, they are expanding their range due to deforestation. The western burrowing owls (A. c. hypugaea) are most common in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, as well as in most of the western states. Known resident populations inhabit areas of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and California, where their population is reportedly threatened by human encroachment and construction.\n\nBurrowing owls range from the southern portions of the western Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba) and all the way through Mexico to western Panamá. They are also found across the state of Florida, as well as some Caribbean islands. In South America, they are fairly common, and are known to inhabit  every country on the continent, with the exception of the dense Amazon rainforest interior and the highest ranges of the Andes Mountains. Their preference is for the cooler, possibly sub-tropical coastal and temperate regions. South of the Amazon, their population seems to again rebound, as they are widely distributed from southern Brazil and the Pantanal down to Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.\n\nBurrowing owls are year-round residents in most of their range. Birds that breed in Canada and the northern U.S. usually migrate south to Mexico and the southern U.S. during winter months.\n\nThis species can live for at least 9 years in the wild and over 10 years in captivity. They are often killed by vehicles when crossing roads, and have many natural enemies, including badgers, coyotes, and snakes. They are also killed by both feral and domestic cats and dogs. Two birds studied in the Parque Nacional de La Macarena of Colombia were free of blood parasites.\n\nBurrowing owls often nest and roost in the burrows made by ground squirrels, a strategy also used by rattlesnakes. When threatened, the owl retreats to the burrow and produces rattling and hissing sounds similar to those of a rattlesnake. The behavior is suggested to be an example of acoustic Batesian mimicry and has been observed to be an effective strategy against animals that are familiar with the dangers posed by rattlesnakes.\n\nThe nesting season begins in late March or April in North America. Burrowing owls usually only have one mate but occasionally a male will have two mates. Pairs of owls will sometimes nest in loose colonies. Their typical breeding habitat is open grassland or prairie, but they can occasionally adapt to other open areas like airports, golf courses, and agricultural fields. Burrowing owls are slightly tolerant of human presence, often nesting near roads, farms, homes, and regularly maintained irrigation canals.\n\nThe owls nest in a burrow, hence the name burrowing owl. If burrows are unavailable and the soil is not hard or rocky, the owls may excavate their own. Burrowing owls will also nest in shallow, underground, man-made structures that have easy access to the surface.\n\nDuring the nesting season, burrowing owls will collect a wide variety of materials to line their nest, some of which are left around the entrance to the burrow. The most common material is mammal dung, usually from cattle. At one time it was thought that the dung helped to mask the scent of the juvenile owls, but researchers now believe the dung helps to control the microclimate inside the burrow and to attract insects, which the owls may eat.\n\nThe female lays an egg every one or two days until she has completed a clutch, which can consist of four to 12 eggs (usually 9). She then incubates the eggs for 3–4 weeks while the male brings her food. After the eggs hatch, both parents feed the chicks. Four weeks after hatching, the chicks can make short flights and begin leaving the nest burrow. The parents still help feed the chicks for 1–3 months.\n\nSite fidelity rates appear to vary among populations. In some locations, owls will frequently reuse a nest several years in a row. Owls in migratory northern populations are less likely to return to the same burrow every year. Also, as with many other birds, the female owls are more likely to disperse to a different site than are male owls.\n\nWhen hunting, they wait on a perch until they spot prey. Then, they swoop down on prey or fly up to catch insects in flight. Sometimes, they chase prey on foot across the ground. The highly variable diet includes invertebrates and small vertebrates, which make up roughly one third and two thirds of the diet, respectively. Burrowing owls mainly eat large insects and small rodents. Although burrowing owls often live close to ground squirrels (Marmotini), they rarely prey upon them. They also hunt bats. An analysis of burrowing owl diets in the Dominican Republic found the owls consumed ~53% invertebrates, ~28% other birds, ~15% reptiles, ~3% amphibians, and 1% mammals.\n\nRodent prey is usually dominated by locally superabundant species, like the delicate vesper mouse (Calomys tener) in southern Brazil. Among squamates and amphibians, small lizards like the tropical house gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia), snakes, frogs, and toads predominate. Generally, most vertebrate prey is in the weight class of several grams per individual. The largest prey are usually birds, such as eared doves (Zenaida auriculata) which may weigh almost as much as a burrowing owl, as well as sparrows.\n\nRegarding invertebrates, the burrowing owl seems less of a generalist. It is extremely fond of termites such as Termitidae, and Orthoptera such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae), true crickets (Gryllidae) and grasshoppers. Bothynus and Dichotomius anaglypticus scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) were eaten far more often than even closely related species by many burrowing owls across central São Paulo (Brazil). Similarly, it was noted that among scorpions Bothriuridae were much preferred, among spiders Lycosidae (wolf spiders), and among millipedes (Diplopoda) certain Diplocheta. Small ground beetles (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as burrowing owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species can put up. Earthworms are also preyed upon. Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beetles, which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls. Burrowing owls can also predate on invertebrates attracted to artificial night lighting.\n\nUnlike other owls, they also eat fruits and seeds, especially the fruit of tasajillo (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis) and other prickly pear and cholla cacti. On Clarion Island, where mammalian prey is lacking, they feed essentially on crickets and prickly pear fruit, adding Clarión wrens (Troglodytes tanneri) and young Clarion mourning doves (Zenaida macroura clarionensis) on occasion.\n\nThe burrowing owl is endangered in Canada and threatened in Mexico. It is a state threatened species in Colorado and Florida and a California species of special concern. It is common and widespread in open regions of many Neotropical countries, where they sometimes even inhabit fields and parks in cities. In regions bordering the Amazon Rainforest they are spreading with deforestation. It is therefore listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Burrowing owls are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. They are also included in CITES Appendix II. NatureServe lists the species as Apparently Secure.\n\nIn March 2024, Center for Biological Diversity, Urban Bird Foundation, Defenders of Wildlife, Burrowing Owl Preservation Society, Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, Central Valley Bird Club and San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society submitted a California Endangered Species Act listing petition to the  Fish and Game Commission to get protections for five populations of the western burrowing owl.\n\nThe petition requests  endangered status for burrowing owls in southwestern California, central-western California and the San Francisco Bay Area, and  threatened status for burrowing owls in the  Central Valley and southern desert  range.\n\nThe major reasons for declining populations in North America are loss of habitat, and control programs for prairie dogs. While some species of burrowing owl can dig their own burrows, most species rely on burrowing animals to burrow holes that the owls can use as shelter and nesting space. There is a high correlation between the location of burrowing animal colonies, like those of ground squirrels, with the presence of burrowing owls. Rates of burrowing owl decline have also been shown to correlate with prairie dog decline. Western burrowing owls, for example, nest in burrows made by black-tailed prairie dogs since they are unable to dig their own. However, prairie dog populations have experienced a decline, one of the causes of this being prairie dog eradication programs. When prairie dogs dig burrows, they can uproot plants in the process. This is most common in agricultural areas, where burrows cause damage to existing crops, creating a problem for local farmers. In Nebraska and Montana, eradication programs have already been put in place to manage the population of prairie dogs. Eradication programs for ground squirrels have also been put in place. In California, California ground squirrels have been known to feed on crop seedlings as well as grasses meant for cattle, which prevents crop growth and decreases food supply for cattle. However, as burrowing animal populations decrease, burrowing owls become more vulnerable to exposure to predators. With fewer burrows available, burrowing owl populations will be more concentrated, with more owls occupying fewer burrows . As a result, predators will more easily detect owl populations and be capable of eliminating larger broods of owls at once. Prairie dogs and ground squirrels also act as a buffer between owls and their predators, since they become the target prey rather than the owls. Another benefit prairie dogs in particular provide burrowing owls takes the form of their alarm calls, which alert burrowing owls if predators are nearby, therefore giving the owls ample time to hide or escape. Without burrowing animals, almost every aspect contributing to suitable and safe living for burrowing owls will no longer be available. Organizations have tried contributing to the conservation of burrowing owls by digging artificial burrows for these owls to occupy in areas with no active colony of burrowing animals. However, creating artificial burrows is not sustainable and is not effective as a long term solution.\n\nBurrowing owls readily inhabit some anthropogenic landscapes, such as airport grasslands or golf courses, and are known to take advantage of artificial nest sites (plastic burrows with tubing for the entrance) and perches. Burrowing owls have demonstrated similar reproductive success in rural grasslands and urban settings. The urban-residing burrowing owls have also developed the behavior of digging their own burrows and exhibit different fear responses to human and domestic dogs compared to their rural counterparts. Research has suggested that this species has made adaptations to the rapid urbanization of their usual habitat, and conservation efforts should be considered accordingly. Genetic analysis of the two North American subspecies indicates that inbreeding is not a problem within those populations.\n\nWhere the presence of burrowing owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations need to start several months prior to the anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good burrowing owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to be interested in the location – if possible, this should be at the onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way trapdoor design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose. If everything has been correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site in the course of a few nights at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.\n\nSome organizations like Center for Biological Diversity and Urban Bird Foundation contend that the removal from their burrows, either through active or passive relocation, has been a factor in the extirpation of burrowing owl populations in California because of the species high site fidelity.",

The two living solenodon species are the Cuban solenodon (Atopogale cubana) and the Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus). Threats to both species include habitat destruction and predation by non-native cats, dogs, and mongooses, introduced by humans to the solenodons' home islands to control snakes and rodents.\n\nThe Hispaniolan solenodon covers a wide range of habitats on the island of Hispaniola from lowland dry forest to highland pine forest. Two other described species became extinct during the Quaternary period. Oligocene North American genera, such as Apternodus, have been suggested as relatives of Solenodon, but the origins of the animal remain obscure.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Two genera, Atopogale and Solenodon, are known, each with one extant species. Other genera have been erected, but are now regarded as junior synonyms. Solenodontidae show retention of primitive mammal characteristics. In 2016, solenodons were confirmed by genetic analysis as belonging to an evolutionary branch that split from the lineage leading to hedgehogs, moles, and shrews before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. They are one of two families of Caribbean soricomorphs. The other family, Nesophontidae, became extinct during the Holocene. Molecular data suggest they diverged from solenodons roughly 57 million years ago. The solenodon is estimated to have diverged from other living mammals about 73 million years ago.\n\nIn addition, 2 extinct species, the giant solenodon (S. arredondoi) and Marcano's solenodon (S. marcanoi) are both thought to have gone extinct during the last 500 years, both presumably due to predation by introduced rats.\n\nTraditionally, solenodons' closest relatives were considered to be the giant water shrew of Africa and Tenrecidae of Madagascar, though they are now known to be more closely related to true shrews (Eulipotyphla). Solenodons resemble very large shrews, and are often compared to them; with extremely elongated cartilaginous snouts, long, naked, scaly tails, hairless feet, and small eyes. The Cuban solenodon is generally smaller than its Hispaniolan counterpart. It is also a rusty brown with black on its throat and back. The Hispaniolan solenodon is a darker brown with yellowish tint to the face. The snout is flexible and, in the Hispaniolan solenodon, actually has a ball-and-socket joint at the base to increase its mobility. This allows the animal to investigate narrow crevices where potential prey may be hiding.\n\nSolenodons are also noted for the glands in their inguinal and groin areas that secrete what is described as a musky, goat-like odor. Solenodons range from 28 to 32 cm (11 to 13 in) from nose to rump, and weigh between 0.7 and 1.0 kg (1.5 and 2.2 lb).\n\nSolenodons have a few unusual traits, one of them being the position of the two teats on the female, almost on the buttocks of the animal, and another being the venomous saliva that flows from modified salivary glands in the mandible through grooves on the second lower incisors (\"solenodon\" derives from the Greek \"grooved tooth\"). Solenodons are among a handful of venomous mammals. Fossil records show that some other now-extinct mammal groups also had the dental venom delivery system, indicating that the solenodon's most distinct characteristic may have been a more general ancient mammalian characteristic that has been lost in most modern mammals and is only retained in a couple of very ancient lineages. The solenodon has often been called a \"living fossil\" because it has endured virtually unchanged for the past 76 million years.[citation needed]\n\nIt is not known exactly how long solenodons can live in the wild. However, certain individuals of the Cuban species have been recorded to have lived for up to five years in captivity and individuals of the Hispaniolan species for up to eleven years.[citation needed]\n\nWest Indian natives have long known about the venomous character of the solenodon bite. Early studies on the nature of the tiny mammal's saliva suggested that it was very similar to the neurotoxic venom of certain snakes.  More recently, the venom has been found to be related to that of the northern short-tailed shrew and it is mostly composed of kallikreins KLK1, serine proteases that prevent blood clotting, cause hypotension and ultimately end up being fatal to the prey. The KLK1 in solenodon venom is very similar to serine protease found in venomous snakes like vipers, and has evolved in parallel in both lineages from an ancient toxin precursor. Solenodons create venom in enlarged submaxillary glands, and only inject venom through their bottom set of teeth. The symptoms of a solenodon bite include general depression, breathing difficulty, paralysis, and convulsions; large enough doses have resulted in death in lab studies on mice.\n\nTheir diets consist largely of insects, earthworms, and other invertebrates, but they also eat vertebrate carrion, and perhaps even some living vertebrate prey, such as small reptiles or amphibians. They have also been known to feed on fruits, roots, and vegetables. Based on observation of the solenodon in captivity, they have only been known to drink while bathing. Solenodons have a relatively unspecialised, and almost complete dentition, with a dental formula of: 3.1.3.33.1.3.3.\n\nSolenodons find food by sniffing the ground until they come upon their prey. If the prey is small enough, the solenodon will consume it immediately. After coming across the prey, the solenodon will bring the forelimbs up to either side of the prey and then move the head forward, opening the jaw and properly catching its prey.[citation needed] While sniffing for food, the solenodon can get through physical barriers with the help of its sharp claws.\n\nThere has been research that suggests that males and females of the two species have different eating habits. The female has a habit of scattering the food to make sure that no morsel of food is missed as it is foraging. The male was noted to use its tongue to lap up the food and using the lower jaw as a scoop. However, these specimens were studied in captivity, so these habits may not be found in the wild.\n\nSolenodons give birth in a nesting burrow to one or two young. The young remain with the mother for several months and initially follow the mother by hanging on to her elongated teats. Once they reach adulthood solenodons are solitary animals and rarely interact except to breed.\n\nThe reproductive rate of solenodons is relatively low, producing only two litters per year. Breeding can occur at any time. Males will not aid in the care for the young. The mother will nurse her offspring using her two nipples, which are placed toward the back of the animal. If the litter consists of three offspring, one will become malnourished and die. The nursing period can last for up to seventy-five days.\n\nIn their nesting burrows, solenodons give birth to one or two pups, displaying a distinctive reproductive behavior. For several months, the mother tends to them, and the young follow her, clinging on lengthy teats. Breeding can take place at any time, with a comparatively low reproductive rate of two litters annually, and males do not participate in the upbringing of their offspring. Up to 75 days of breastfeeding are dedicated to showcasing the interesting function that mothers play in solenodon reproduction.\n\nSolenodons make their homes in bushy areas in forests. During the daytime they seek refuge in caves, burrows, or hollow logs. They are easily provoked and can fly into a frenzy of squealing and biting with no warning. They run and climb quite fast, despite only ever touching the ground with toes. Solenodons are said to give off grunts similar to that of a pig or bird-call when feeling threatened.\n\nSolenodons generate clicking noises similar to those of shews; the sound waves bounce off objects in their vicinity. This form of echolocation helps a solenodon navigate as well as find food. This well developed auditory ability combined with its above average sense of smell helps the solenodon survive despite its extremely small eyes and poor vision.\n\nThe Cuban solenodon is considered Endangered due to predation by the small Indian mongoose (Urva auropunctata), which was introduced in colonial times to hunt snakes and rats, as well as by feral cats and dogs. The Cuban solenodon was thought to have been extinct until a live specimen was found in 2003.\n\nThe Hispaniolan solenodon was also once thought to be extinct, more due to its secretive and elusive behavior than to low population numbers. Recent studies have proven that the species is widely distributed through the island of Hispaniola, but it does not tolerate habitat degradation. A 1981 study of the Hispaniolan solenodon in Haiti found that the species was \"functionally extinct\", with the exception of a small population in the area of Massif de la Hotte. A follow-up study, in 2007, noted that the solenodon was still thriving in the area, even though the region has had an increase in human population density in recent years.\n\nThe Sierra de Bahoruco, a mountain range in the southwest of the Dominican Republic that straddles the border with Haiti, was examined by conservation teams looking for solenodons. The work occurred during the day when the animals were asleep in burrows so that they could be viewed with an infrared camera. When researchers search for solenodons in daylight, they look for the following clues to their presence:\n\nA solenodon was captured in 2008 during a month-long expedition in the Dominican Republic, thereby allowing researchers the rare opportunity to examine it in daylight. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Ornithological Society of Hispaniola were able to take measurements and DNA from the creature before it was released. It was the only trapping made from the entire month-long expedition. The new information gathered was significant because little information was known about the solenodon's ecology, behavior,  population status, and genetics, and without that knowledge it is difficult for researchers to design effective conservation. In a 2020 assessment from the IUCN, the Hispaniolan solenodon was found to be much more common on Hispaniola than previously thought, warranting its downlisting from \"Endangered\" to a \"Least Concern\" species.\n\nAfter the arrival of Europeans to the Caribbean, the existence of both species of solenodon has been threatened by introduced species, like dogs, cats, rats, and mongooses, as well as more dense human settlement. These factors were possibly the catalyst for the relatively recent extinction of two species, the giant solenodon (S. arredondoi) and the Marcano's solenodon (S. marcanoi). Native snakes and birds of prey are also threats. Solenodons have no known negative effects on human populations; in fact, they serve as both pest control, helping ecosystems by keeping down the population of invertebrates, and a means of spreading fruit seeds. Human activity has also had an adverse effect on the solenodon population. Human development on both Cuba and Hispaniola has resulted in fragmentation and habitat loss, further contributing to the reduction of the solenodon's range and numbers.",

      "name":["Bearded dragon"],
      "introduction":"\n\nPogona is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The name \"bearded dragon\" refers to the underside of the throat (or \"beard\") of the lizard, which can turn black and become inflated for a number of reasons, most often as a result of stress, if they feel threatened, or are trying to entice a mate. They are a semiarboreal species, spending significant amounts of time on branches, in bushes, and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons and sleep at night, making them a diurnal species. Their diet consists primarily of vegetation and some insects. They are found throughout much of Australia and inhabit environments such as deserts, and shrublands.\n\nThe genus Pogona is in the subfamily Amphibolurinae of the lizard group Agamidae. Bearded dragons are characterized by their broad, triangular heads, flattened bodies, and rows and clusters of spiny scales covering their entire bodies. When threatened, bearded dragons puff up their bodies and beards to ward off predators and make their somewhat dull spikes seem more dangerous. Bearded dragons display a hand-waving gesture to show submission (most often when acknowledging another bearded dragon's territory), and a head-bobbing display to show dominance between dragons. Some have the ability to slightly change color in response to certain stimuli including rivalry challenges between males and ambient temperature changes (e.g., turning black to absorb heat). Bearded dragons occur in a variety of colors and morphs and can range from being all dark to completely white under controlled breeding conditions. Males grow up to 60 cm (24 in) long, and females up to 51 cm (20 in).\n\nBearded dragons live in the woodlands, heaths, deserts and coastal dunes, with their range extending throughout the interior of the eastern states to the eastern half of South Australia and southeastern Northern Territory. They are considered to be semiarboreal and quite readily climb and bask at height. This is also linked to dominance behavior and competition for territory/basking areas. They can be found on fallen/broken trees, rocky outcrops, and bushes when basking. Many of the Australian locals have spotted bearded dragons on fence posts and elevated rocky areas. At night, they prefer to dig holes to sleep in, climb in trees, or submerge themselves in rocks and like to climb into the cracks and crevices of stones and caves.\n\nBearded dragons go through a type of hibernation called brumation, in which like hibernation, reptiles go months without eating, but sporadically drink water. Reptiles go dormant in the hottest temperatures, but it differs from brumation during cooler temperatures. When temperatures are extreme, a very small range of temperatures exists through which the reptile's bodies can stay active and where their bodies cannot tolerate the extreme heat and they die. Bearded dragons go through brumation when the temperature goes below 15.5–21.0°C (60–70°F) during the night and 24.0–26.5°C (75–80°F) during the day for 8-10 hours. When the climate is too hot they will often burrow underground. They will also form more permanent burrows or covered hiding places to use as protection from the climate changes at night and predation.",

Any male approaching without displaying submissive behavior is seen as a challenge for  territory. Aggressive males have even been known to attack females that do not display submissive gestures in return.\n\nCorrespondingly, adult male bearded dragons can bite more forcefully than adult females, which is associated with greater head dimensions.\n\nThe bearded dragon occurs in many different colors. The beard itself is used for mating and aggression displays, as well as heat management. It forms part of a range of gestures and signals through which the dragons have basic levels of communication. Both sexes have a beard, but males display more frequently, especially in courtship rituals. Females also display their beards as a sign of aggression. The beard darkens, sometimes turning jet black, and inflates during the display. The bearded dragon may also open its mouth and gape in addition to inflating its beard to appear more intimidating. Extreme behavior such as hissing can be observed when threatened with a predator, inflating the body and tilting towards the threat in defense. Bearded dragons have relatively strong jaws, but often only attack as a last resort when threatened outside of competition with their own species.\n\nHead bobbing is another behavior seen in both females and males; they quickly move their heads up and down, often darkening and flaring their beards. Changes in the pace of head bobbing are thought to be a form of communication. Males head bob to impress females, and a male often has to demonstrate his dominance when attempting to mate before the female will concede. Smaller males often respond to a larger male's head bobbing by arm waving, which is a submissive sign. Females also arm wave to avoid aggression, often in response to a male's head bobbing. Female bearded dragons have been seen lowering themselves towards the ground and intermittently arm waving whilst moving away from a dominant male in an attempt to either appease or escape.\n\nThe bearded dragon has also been shown to perceive illusion, specifically the Delboeuf illusion. In an experiment at the University of Padova, bearded dragons were presented with two different-sized plates with the same amount of food. The bearded dragons chose the smaller plate more often than they chose the larger one, showing that they were able to perceive the illusion and interpret that a larger plate does not always mean more food. This is the first evidence of this behavior being shown in a reptile species.\n\nWhen brumation comes to an end, the male bearded dragon goes out to find a mate. A courtship ritual occurs where the male starts bobbing his head, waving his arms, and stomping his feet in front of the female. The male chases the female and bites the back of her neck and holds on while he gets in position to copulate.\n\nDuring the breeding period, female bearded dragons can store sperm in their oviductal crypts. This allows the females to lay a clutch of 11–30 eggs, twice from one mating.\n\nBearded dragons exhibit temperature sex determination; while the embryo is developing, higher temperatures cause dragons with a male genotype to experience sex reversal and express a female phenotype. This produces a bearded dragon that is a female, but still has a male genotype. Incubation temperatures above 31 °C (88 °F) can cause sex reversal, and the likelihood of sex reversal has a positive correlation with temperature up to 36°C. Incubation temperatures below 31°C cannot trigger sex reversal. Surprisingly, female bearded dragons with a male genotype do not have many differences from genotypic females. According to one study done on bite force, male bearded dragons have a higher bite force than genotypic females, and sex-reversed females, but no difference was seen between genotypic females and sex-reversed females.\n\nLike many other reptile species (and what is most often observed in birds), females are capable of laying eggs even without fertilization. These eggs appear slightly smaller and softer, and contain a yellow yolk when broken open.\n\nDuring the development of an embryo, abnormalities may result in birth defects. These abnormalities might be caused by chromosomal disorders, chemicals, or other genetic or environmental factors.\n\nThe central bearded dragon is the most common species in captivity, as well as one of the most popular pet reptiles, with some smaller species such as Pogona henrylawsoni being used as substitutes where less housing space is available. Introduced into the U.S. as pets during the 1990s, bearded dragons have gained much popularity as an exotic pet. This popularity has been sustained, even after Australia banned the sale of its wildlife as pets in the 1960s.\n\nGenerally, the bearded dragon is a solitary animal. Males are usually housed alone, as they fight with other males and breed with females. Captive adults reach about 40 to 61 cm (16 to 24 in) from head to tail, weigh 290 to 600 g (10 to 20 oz) and live for about 10 to 15 years and longer with good care. They have been known to live up to about 15 years in captivity, and the current world record is 18 years.\n\nThrough selective breeding, many different versions of the central bearded dragon have been developed, referred to as \"morphs\". They have a few main genetic traits, including \"hypomelanism\" and \"translucent\", which refer to traits physically displayed by the dragon. Bearded dragons with hypomelanism tend to have lighter and more vibrant coloration. Translucents have a less opaque quality to their skin, making their colors seem stronger, and have black eyes. Also, \"leatherbacks\" have reduced scale texture to give a smoother skin, \"silkbacks\" have softer outer skin, and \"German giants\" are larger than average. Silkbacks in particular require special care, as they have far more delicate skin, and as such, require different UV and humidity requirements. They also tend to live shorter lives.\n\nAlthough bearded dragons are fairly resilient to illness, improper care can potentially kill a bearded dragon. Some health issues that bearded dragons may have include metabolic bone disease, adenovirus, impaction, polarisation, dystocia, Yellow Fungus Disease and parasites. The majority of health issues bearded dragons face in captivity are due to poor diet and inadequate heat and lighting.\n\nMetabolic bone disease (MBD) is a collective term for several common diseases/illnesses that can be fatal and is probably the most common health problem of bearded dragons. A main attribute of MBD is the weakening of the skeletal structure and possible deformation. It occurs in bearded dragons due to malnutrition or the use of improper lighting, meaning they are unable to properly assimilate calcium from their diet or there isn't enough in their diet. Most bearded dragons in captivity will be fed supplementation and all will need a UVB light to enable them to properly use calcium in their diet. Typical foods that bearded dragons eat, including kale, mustard greens, and collard greens, are high in calcium and should be eaten daily along with other leafy greens and vegetables to have a well-balanced diet. Bearded dragons require UVB lights to process calcium in their diet. Without processing this calcium, their bodies will use calcium from their bones, therefore weakening them. Symptoms seen in bearded dragons with MBD include bumps in the legs, twitches or tremors, bumps along the spine or tail, a swollen bottom jaw, and jerky movements.\n\nHypocalcemia occurs when there are low levels of calcium in the bearded dragon's blood. Hypocalcemia is most often tied to metabolic bone disease. Low levels of calcium can result in twitching muscles, or seizures. Hypocalcemia is most often seen in young bearded dragons, as they are slightly more fragile than adults. Maintaining a diet that consists of enough calcium is crucial to avoiding hypocalcemia as well as metabolic bone disease.\n\nImpaction occurs often in bearded dragons when they are fed food that is too big for them. Bearded dragons will try to eat worms or crickets that are too big for them, but this can be extremely harmful. Food should not be bigger than the space between their eyes for a young dragon. Older dragons can generally cope with larger insects but not oversized prey. If a dragon eats food that is too big for it, pressure will be put on its spinal cord during digestion. This pressure can lead to impaction which can lead to death. Another cause of impaction in captivity is ingestion of the substrate, commonly sand or other loose substrates.\n\nIn bearded dragons, respiratory infection (RI) is caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs. Bearded dragons develop a respiratory infection due to a number of reasons such as incorrect lighting and temperature, high humidity, prolonged psychological stress, and poor captive conditions.\n\nAtadenovirus (ADV), also referred to as adenovirus, can be deadly. ADV can be spread between reptiles through contact alone. Most juvenile ADV-positive bearded dragons do not live past 90 days. While ADV-positive adults will live longer, they eventually contract liver diseases. Common symptoms of ADV-positive bearded dragons include stunted growth and slow weight gain. Because of their compromised immune systems, ADV-positive bearded dragons may be infected with intestinal parasites.\n\nBearded dragons require UVB to enable vitamin D3 synthesis and to prevent illnesses like metabolic bone disease. Vitamin D3 is essential to calcium absorption, with calcium playing a major role in various critical biological functions. Bearded dragons also require UVA, which stimulates feeding, breeding, basking and overall health. They also require a basking heat source, most commonly a light-emitting source, to provide a basking area. Heat and UV are both vital to the bearded dragons' biological function.\n\nThe following six species are recognised as being valid.\n\nNota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described under a different binomial.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), also known as Audubon's cottontail, is a New World cottontail rabbit, and a member of the family Leporidae. Unlike the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), they do not form social burrow systems, but compared with some other leporids, they are extremely tolerant of other individuals in their vicinity.\n\nCottontails give birth to their kits in burrows vacated by other mammals. They sometimes cool off, or take refuge in scratched out shallow created depressions of their own making, using their front paws like a back hoe. They are not usually active in the middle of the day, but can be observed foraging in the early morning, and early evening. Cottontails are rarely found out of their burrows looking for food on windy days, because the wind interferes with their ability to hear approaching predators, their primary defense mechanism.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The lifespan of a cottontail that reaches adulthood averages less than two years, depending on the location. Unfortunately for the cottontail, almost every local carnivore larger or faster than the lagomorph is its predator. Some predators, like snakes for example, are familiar with the area inhabited by the cottontails, and can catch and eat the young at will; the mother is unable to defend the litter. Although cottontails are highly active sexually, and mated pairs have multiple litters throughout the year, few young survive to adulthood. Those that survive grow quickly and are full grown at three months.\n\nThe desert cottontail is quite similar in appearance to the European rabbit, though its ears are larger and are more often carried erect. It is social among its peers, often gathering in small groups to feed. Like all cottontail rabbits, the desert cottontail has a greyish-brown, rounded tail with a broad white edge and white underside, which is visible as it runs away. It also has white fur on the belly.\n\nAdults are 36 to 42 cm (14 to 17 in) long and weigh anywhere from 700 to 1,200 g (1.5 to 2.6 lb). The tail is 3.0 to 6.0 cm (1.2 to 2.4 in), ears are 6 to 9 cm (2.4 to 3.5 in) long and the hindfeet are large, about 7 to 9 cm (2.8 to 3.5 in) in length. There is little sexual dimorphism, but females tend to be larger than the males, but have much smaller home ranges, about 4,000 m2 (1 acre) compared with about 61,000 m2 (15 acres) for a male.\n\nThe desert cottontail is found throughout the Western United States from eastern Montana to western Texas, and in Northern and Central Mexico. Its eastern range extends barely into the Great Plains. Westward, its range extends to central Nevada,  central and southern California and Baja California, touching the Pacific Ocean. It is found at heights of up to 1,830 m (6,000 ft). It is particularly associated with the dry near-desert grasslands of the American southwest, though it is also found in less arid habitats such as pinyon-juniper forest. It is also frequently found in the riparian zones in arid regions.\n\nCottontails are herbivores, with 90% of their diet consisting of grass.  They also feed on the leaves and peas of mesquite, barks, fallen fruit, the juicy pads of prickly pear and twigs of shrubs. It rarely needs to drink, getting its water mostly from the plants it eats or from dew. Due to seasonality and changes in moisture conditions of their habitat, cottontails adjust their diets based on many influential factors that impact the seasonal changes of vegetation (i.e. moisture content, abundance, nutrition value, etc.). Like most lagomorphs, it is coprophagic, re-ingesting and chewing its own feces to extract the nutrients as effectively as possible.\n\nThe desert cottontail, like all cottontails, eats on all fours. It can only use its nose to move and adjust the position of the food that it places directly in front of its front paws on the ground. The cottontail turns the food with its nose to find the cleanest part of the vegetation (free of sand and inedible parts) to begin its meal. The only time a cottontail uses its front paws to enable eating is when vegetation is above its head on a living plant. The cottontail then lifts a paw to bend the branch and bring the food within reach.\n\nDue to variable temperatures of their habitats, desert cottontails must be adequate thermoregulators to minimize water loss during the hotter seasons and require shaded areas of their environment to conduct evaporative water loss through thermal heat transfer. In open-desert areas, they can withstand for a short period extremely high temperatures of around  45 °C (113 °F), and have a large evaporative water loss capacity of around 1.5% body mass/hour, though cottontails can withstand longer in an ideal environment with shaded areas. To cope with evaporative heat loss, they do panting and undergo changes in production of their basal metabolic rate in relation to the ambient temperature of the environment. Ears of desert cottontails make up 14% of their body size and may help with thermoregulation.\n\nMany desert animals prey on cottontails, including birds of prey, mustelids, coyotes, bobcats, Mexican wolves, mountain lions, snakes, weasels, humans, and even squirrels, should a cottontail be injured or docile from illness. Alien species, such as cats and dogs, are also known predators, and also pose a threat. Southwestern Native Americans hunted them for meat but also used their fur and hides. It is also considered a game species, due to which it is hunted for sport. The desert cottontail's normal behavior upon spotting a potential predator is to freeze in place in an attempt to avoid being detected. If it determines that it is in danger, it will flee the area by hopping away in a zigzag pattern. Cottontails can reach speeds of over 30 km/h (19 mph). When defending itself against small predators or other desert cottontails, it will nudge with its nose, or slap with its front paws, usually preceded by a hop straight upwards as high as two feet when threatened or taken by surprise.\n\nHabitat loss due to land clearing and cattle grazing may severely affect the population of the desert cottontail. Human-induced fires are also a potential threat for desert cottontail populations. Another factor is its competition with the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), because both have the same diet, and share the same habitat. When a season has been particularly dry, there is less plant life to go around. The cottontail does not fear the jackrabbit, in fact the jackrabbit is very skittish and will retreat from a confrontation in most instances. However, the black-tailed jackrabbit is much bigger, and consumes much more food at eating times.\n\nAn extremely wet winter season means increased plant life in the spring, and thus increases in cottontail populations. However, if the wet winter is followed by a particularly dry summer, the plant life dries up quickly due to the extreme desert summer temperatures, and can have the opposite effect, and can lead to hunger for the now over-populated cottontails.\n\nSince 1996, the desert cottontail has been rated of least concern on the IUCN Red List; it does not appear on the state or federal list of endangered species. The desert cottontail is considered a game species in the United States by individual state wildlife agencies. It is also not considered to be threatened by the state game agencies in the United States, It is common throughout most of its range in Mexico. None of the twelve subspecies are thought to be under threat and no new conservation measures are needed.",

They range across the Indo-Pacific from southern Africa to Hawaii, and are the predominant species of stingray in the inshore waters of the Hawaiian Islands. This benthic fish also inhabits sandy or muddy flats at depths greater than 15 m (49 ft) in the Eastern Atlantic, from southern France to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea. Usually growing to 1 m (3 ft) across, the broad stingray has a wide, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc with a protruding snout tip and a long tail with a ventral fin fold. At night, this species actively forages for bottom-dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes, often near the boundaries of reefs. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous. As substantial threats to its population exist in many areas of its wide distribution, IUCN has listed this species as Vulnerable.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"American zoologist Samuel Garman described the broad stingray in an 1880 issue of the scientific journal Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, giving it the name Trygon lata from the Latin word for \"broad\". Subsequent authors synonymized Trygon with Dasyatis. The type specimen was collected from what were then called the \"Sandwich Islands\", and measures 52 cm (20 in) across.\n\nLisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphological characters, found that the sister species of the broad stingray is the roughtail stingray (B. centroura), and that they form a clade with the southern stingray (Hypanus americanus) and the longtail stingray (H. longus). As B. centroura is found in the Atlantic, this suggests that it and B. lata evolutionarily diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (about 3 million years ago). A further review based on Molecular phylogenetic data in 2016 added Dasyatis thetidis, Dasyatis ushiei, and eastern Atlantic B. centroura as populations of this species.\n\nBathytoshia lata occurs in the eastern Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific from southern Africa to the Hawaiian Islands  and is also found in the Mediterranean Sea  with occasional records from Spain to Turkey.\n\nThis species is common in coastal bays with mud or silt bottoms, and may also be encountered in sandy areas or near coral reefs. It is most common at depths between 40–200 m (130–660 ft) but is found as far down as 800 m (2,600 ft).\n\nThe broad stingray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc a fourth wider than long, with nearly straight leading margins that converge at an obtuse angle, and curved trailing margins. The tip of the snout is rounded and protrudes past the disc. The mouth is arched and contains five or six papillae on the floor, two of which are in front of the others. The pelvic fins are short and rounded. The whip-like tail is twice or more  the length of the disc, and bears a serrated stinging spine on the upper surface near the tail base. A long, narrow fin fold occurs beneath the tail, which eventually becomes a keel that runs all the way to the tail tip.\n\nLarger rays have three large, elongated tubercles in the middle of the back; the tail is roughened by small dermal denticles, along with an irregular row of conical tubercles on each side and several large, flattened tubercles in front of the spine. This species is plain olive to brown above and white below. Though rarely found so far west, the similar-looking diamond stingray (Hypanus dipterurus) is the only other nearshore stingray that occurs off Hawaii; it can be distinguished from this species by its tail, which is shorter and has both upper and lower fin folds. The broad stingray can reach 1.5 m (5 ft) across and 56 kg (123 lb) in weight, though few exceed 1 m (3 ft) across.\n\nDuring the day, the broad stingray is relatively inactive and spends much time lying half-buried on the bottom. A tracking study in Kaneohe Bay found that individuals rays roamed over an average area of 0.83 km2 (0.32 sq mi) at night, compared to an average diurnal activity space of 0.12 km2 (0.046 sq mi), and did not rest consistently in any particular spot. Rays were most active 2 hours after sunset and before sunrise, and were more active in the higher water temperatures of summer than winter. The behavior of this species was not significantly influenced by tides, likely because they inhabit deeper water.\n\nThe broad stingray feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling crustaceans, while also taking polychaete worms and small bony fishes. It excavates large pits to uncover buried prey, and is often followed by opportunists such as jacks. Foraging rays favor areas close to reef boundaries, where many parrotfish, wrasses, gobies, and other reef fishes shelter at night. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium chengi, Rhinebothrium hawaiiensis, Pterobothrium hawaiiensis, Prochristianella micracantha, and Parachristianella monomegacantha.\n\nLike other stingrays, the broad stingray is aplacental viviparous. Kaneohe Bay appears to be a nursery area for this species, where juvenile scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini) and it are the dominant predators. Off North Africa, birthing occurs in June and December, indicating either that females bear two litters per year with a four-month gestation period, or that there are two cohorts of females bearing one litter per year with a ten-month gestation period.\n\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature formerly assessed the broad stingray as Least Concern, but this was upgraded to Vulnerable in 2021 as it is not known what part of its range overlaps with marine protected areas. This species has become a popular subject for display at public aquariums and resorts.",

      "sections":"The vernacular name \"royal antelope\" is based on a statement made by Willem Bosman, a merchant associated with the Dutch West India Company, that the antelope was called \"the king of the harts\" (i.e., the king of the antelope) by locals.\n\nThe scientific name is Neotragus pygmaeus /niːˈɒtrəɡəs pɪɡˈmiːəs/. It is placed in the genus Neotragus and the family Bovidae. It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of Systema Naturae (1758). German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas recognised two species – Tragulus pygmaeus and Antilope pygmaea. However, both of them were found to have the same type, the royal antelope. Hence these are treated as synonyms for N. pygmaeus.\n\nThe generic name Neotragus consists of two Greek roots: νέος (néos), \"new\", and τράγος (trágos), \"he-goat\", while the specific name pygmaeus comes from the Greek πυγμαῖος (pugmaîos), \"pygmy, fist-sized\".\n\nThe tribe Neotragini comprises a variety of dwarf antelopes apart from Neotragus – these include Dorcatragus (beira), Ourebia (oribi), Madoqua (dik dik), Oreotragus (klipspringer) and Raphicerus. The tribe has been shown to be paraphyletic. A 2014 phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome b sequences and linear skull measurements showed polyphyly in Neotragus. The royal antelope is likely to have had an ancestor in common with the klipspringer and duikers (subfamily Cephalophinae). The genus Neotragus was formerly confused with the distantly related pygmy antelope genus Nesotragus (von Düben, 1846), from Greek νῆσος (nêsos), \"island\".\n\nThe royal antelope is the smallest antelope and ruminant in the world. It is also the smallest African ungulate, followed by Bates's pygmy antelope (Nesotragus batesi). The royal antelope reaches merely 25 cm (9.8 in) at the shoulder and weighs 2.5–3 kg (5.5–6.6 lb). The head and body length is typically 40 cm (16 in). A characteristic feature is the long and slender legs, with the hindlegs twice as long as the forelegs – a remarkable similarity to a hare. The thin tail, 5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) long, is white on the underside, ending in a white tuft. The species is sexually dimorphic, with females being larger than males. Only males possess horns, these being short, smooth, ventrally reflexed spikes measuring 2.5–3 cm (1.0–1.2 in) long.\n\nThe soft coat is reddish to golden brown, in sharp contrast with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.  In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles.\n\nThe royal antelope exhibits remarkable alertness, and consequently little is known about its behaviour. The animal will immediately seek cover if alarmed and flees as soon as the danger is very close. It can move swiftly, either by sprinting fast with the body low to the ground, or through strong leaps powered by the large, well-muscled hindlegs. It can cover 2.8 m (9.2 ft) in a single leap, and rise as high as 55 centimetres (22 in) above the ground.\nIt is typically nocturnal (active at night), though activity may also be observed during the day. It generally rests or ruminates during the day. Territories are marked with dung. The reduced size of the preorbital glands, which are used for scent-marking, could indicate that marking behavior is not very prominent in this antelope.\n\nA herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi may be taken occasionally. Though the antelope is considered to be nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.\n\nLike other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous, though polygamy has been occasionally observed. Individuals of both sexes have been known to reach sexual maturity by six months of age. Births have been reported in November and December. Typically a single, delicate offspring is born after an unknown gestational period, weighing 0.8–1 kg (1.8–2.2 lb) – nearly a third of an adult's weight. Young appear similar to adults in coloration. The maximum lifespan of a captive royal antelope was estimated at six years and eight months by a 1993 study.\n\nThe royal antelope prefers areas with fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African countries such as Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The animal's habitat also includes forest fringes and secondary forests. Its geographic range extends eastward from the Kounounkan Massif in southwestern Guinea through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire to the Volta River in Ghana. The royal antelope may also be found in the region north to the forested areas of western Africa, which is marked by the interface of forest and savannah habitats.\n\nThe royal antelope has been categorized as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the total population to be about 62,000; however, this is likely to be an underestimate. The populations are thought to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat to the survival of this antelope is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of bushmeat in Côte d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal antelope occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya Classified Forest (Côte d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke Forest Reserves (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).",

It is found in dry and arid regions across the southern United States and into northwestern Mexico. Their body is about 13–18 mm long and they have relatively long legs in order to run after their prey. Desert grass spiders can withstand very low temperatures even though they do not cold harden. It constructs the characteristic funnel-shaped webs in crevices where the funnel will fit, where they wait in the tube for prey which they can run after using their long legs. They often hunt for their prey at night.\n\nA. aperta is known for its territoriality and will fight intruders to protect their space. A. aperta are mainly monogamous, and the male performs an elaborate courtship ritual that involves swaying his abdomen and releasing pheromones. The male's pheromones induce a cataplectic state in the female, and then once the female is active again, they begin to mate. Desert grass spiders inject venom into their prey which results in rapid paralysis. Bites to humans, however, are not well-studied and are currently considered harmless. The agatoxin present in its venom has been researched extensively and is known to block calcium channels.",

This appearance of a light body with two stripes is common in funnel weaving spiders. Their legs are relatively long, which allows them to run quickly in order to catch any prey that has fallen onto their non-sticky web. Desert grass spiders' cephalothorax and abdomen together are usually 13–18 mm long. Females are larger in size than males, as is common in all grass spiders. Desert grass spiders have prominent spinnerets, which are the organs that make silk for spiders' webs. Their spinnerets are long and extend out of the end of their abdomen. Desert grass spiders have eight eyes, which are in two rows arranged in an arc.\n\nAs suggested by their name, desert grass spiders are found in dry and arid climates, such as those in the southwestern United States, from southern California to Texas, to northwestern Mexico. They can be found in a variety of different habitats, from grasslands to lava beds to rangeland. They are also occasionally found in people's homes or other buildings in these areas of the United States and Mexico. They create their webs in corners of these buildings or other undisturbed locations.\n\nA. aperta are able to tolerate very low temperatures. Research has shown that they were not injured when exposed to very low temperatures directly above their body. However, it was also discovered that they do not cold harden, which is the process of the spider acquiring more traits that will help them survive cold temperatures. It is likely that the spiders move to more protected areas of their habitat during periods of extreme temperatures to compensate for the lack of cold hardening.\n\nA. aperta are funnel weavers, which are known for their characteristic funnel-shaped webs. These webs consist of a flat surface that is connected to a deep tube, which is known as the funnel. The spider waits in the tube, and when it senses motion on the flat sheet of its web, it emerges from the tube to catch its prey. In case of any damage to its web, these spiders can also escape out of the bottom of the funnel through an opening in order to get to safety. Due to their unique shape and the speed at which spiders can catch their prey, their webs are made of non-sticky silk. Their webs are often found close to the ground, which allows them to capture more prey that might fall into them. Some common locations for them to build their webs are in crevices where the funnel would fit, such as in-between rocks or on top of a bush. The placement of their webs depends on the type of environment. In grassland habitats they are placed in patches of tall grass. In lava beds, they are typically associated with shrubs, and on the outskirts of lava beds they are usually in depressions. These are good locations for the funnel webs. Spiders that find the best sites for their webs grow to be the largest in size and are considered to have the highest relative fitness.\n\nThe desert grass spider shows evidence of territoriality. The regular distribution pattern of their webs and observations of agonistic behavior are both characteristic of territoriality. Studies have also shown that more combative spiders have larger territories.\n\nThere has been a significant amount of research on the territoriality and fighting of A. aperta. Biologist Susan Riechert found that these spiders often engage in fights over their territory and studied whether these fights were worth the potential risks of injury, predation, or loss of time. In a fight between an intruder and an owner of a particular piece of territory, the costs were found to be higher for the intruders. Overall, she concluded that the energy used in these territory disputes was not significant and was worth the potential gains.\n\nThese spiders prey on insects that come onto their webs. Insects that are typically found in grass are common prey, such as grasshoppers and aphids, as well as other spiders. Desert grass spiders are most active at night in their search for food, but may be seen emerging from their funnel during the daytime if prey steps on the flat part of their webs. A. aperta can tell the difference between more profitable and less profitable prey, with “profit” meaning how much energy they gain from the prey and how risky it was for them to find it. However, they do not attack more profitable prey more often than less profitable. In populations where the amount of available prey was limited, spiders tried to catch much more of the prey they encountered than if prey was not scarce. This was especially true if there was a low predation risk as well.\n\nThe major predators of A. aperta are birds. There is very little predation on A. aperta that live in grassland environments, but there is a significant amount of predation on spiders in woodland habitats. Research has shown that spider's anti-predatory behavior is associated with foraging, because foraging puts them at a higher risk and requires them to be more vigilant about predators.\n\nA. aperta are mostly monogamous, which is more likely in situations where the males have high costs to travel to their mate or if the female is much less responsive after the first mating. There are some cases of polygyny seen as well, in about 10% of spiders. Males are much more likely to mate with multiple females than the other way around. Male size is the determining factor in fights over a female, with the larger male emerging as the winner since their size signifies success in future offspring. The determining factor for female success is their capacity to win fights over food.\n\nFor the courtship ritual, the male comes to the female's web for their mating. He sways his abdomen from side to side and then stops for a certain amount of time, and then continues the ritualistic swaying. This is repeated several times. The male also moves the web with his legs. It seems that the quicker the male sways his abdomen, the more successful he is likely to be. The female enters a cataplectic state, which means they lose control of their bodies and are unconscious. Experiments have shown that the cataplectic state is induced by pheromones from the males that are airborne. It has been determined that 3 cm is the range within which this chemical is effective. The male's movements during their courtship ritual may also help direct the chemicals towards the female. Some males mate with the females while they are in this unconscious state, but most wait and continue their courtship ritual during this time. The female's choice of mate is affected by the chemical signals as well as the movements from the male's performance.\n\nA. aperta are known for their competitive behavior and they are aggressive. Initially, they have a communal web for all the spiderlings to occupy. They disperse from this communal web and build individual webs near each other. Since there is a high density of siblings near each other, most of them engage in competition over the food.\n\nA. aperta bites to insects result in rapid paralysis. The venom takes less than a second to paralyze the insect. They bite their prey while they are still on the flat part of their web, and then take them down into the funnel portion.\n\nBites from desert grass spiders are typically harmless and therefore not medically significant. However, there have been a few cases of bites from Southern California that resulted in symptoms. It is difficult to say if previous cases of desert spider bites have been confused with other similar looking spiders. Symptoms seen in these cases included headache, weakness, disorientation, pallor, and lethargy. One of these cases was a 9-year-old boy who was bitten on his neck, which may have made the symptoms worse due to his smaller body size and bite location. These symptoms are the same as those seen in the hobo spider (Eratigena agrestis) which is a close relative of the desert grass spider and has recently been blamed for medically significant spider bites.\n\nVenom is stored in glands at the base of the spider's fangs, and they contract the muscles surrounding these glands to emit the venom. There has been a significant amount of research on omega-agatoxin IVA and IVB, which are found in the desert grass spider's venom. This agatoxin selectively blocks calcium channels in humans and results in less calcium being able to flow through them. The reduced calcium leads to a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, meaning they cannot exert their effects as strongly. Agatoxins are named after A. aperta, yet are found in many different types of spider venoms.",

A  specialized inhabitant of the mesopelagic zone, the crocodile shark can be found worldwide in tropical waters from the surface to a depth of 590 m (1,940 ft). It performs a diel vertical migration, staying below a depth of 200 m (660 ft) during the day and ascending into shallower water at night to feed. Typically measuring only 1 m (3.3 ft) in length, the crocodile shark is the smallest living mackerel shark. It can be distinguished by its elongated cigar-shaped body, extremely large eyes, and relatively small fins.\n\nAn active-swimming predator of pelagic bony fishes, squid and shrimp, the crocodile shark has a sizable oily liver that allows it to maintain its position in the water column with minimal effort. The size and structure of its eyes suggests that it is adapted for hunting at night. The crocodile shark is aplacental viviparous, with females typically giving birth to litters of four. The fetuses are oophagous, meaning that they feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated for this purpose by their mother. Due to its small size, the crocodile shark poses little danger to humans and is of little commercial importance. This species was responsible for damaging deep sea fiberoptic cables when the technology was first deployed in 1985.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The English common name \"crocodile shark\" is derived from its Japanese name mizuwani (水鰐, literally \"water crocodile\"), which refers to its sharp teeth and habit of snapping vigorously when taken out of the water. Other common names for this species include Japanese ragged-tooth shark, Kamohara's sand-shark, and water crocodile. The crocodile shark was first described as Carcharias kamoharai in a 1936 issue of Zoological Magazine (Tokyo) by ichthyologist Kiyomatsu Matsubara, based on a 73.5 cm (28.9 in) long specimen found at the Koti Fish Market in Japan. The type specimen is a 1 m (3.3 ft) long adult male found at a fish market in Su-ao, Taiwan.\n\nAfter being shuffled between the genera Carcharias and Odontaspis in the family Odontaspididae by various authors, in 1973 Leonard Compagno resurrected Jean Cadenat's 1963 subgenus Pseudocarcharias from synonymy for this species and placed it within its own family. The morphology of the crocodile shark suggests affinity with the megamouth shark (Megachasmidae), basking shark (Cetorhinidae), thresher sharks (Alopiidae), and mackerel sharks (Lamnidae). More recent phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial DNA, have suggested that the crocodile shark is closely related to either the megamouth shark or the sand sharks (Odontaspididae). Alternately, analysis based on dentition suggests that the closest relatives of the crocodile shark are the thresher sharks, followed by the mackerel sharks. Fossil Pseudocarcharias teeth dating to the Serravallian age (13.6–11.6 Ma) of the Miocene epoch have been found in Italy, and are identical to those of the modern-day crocodile shark.\n\nThe crocodile shark has a spindle-shaped body with a short head and a bulbous, pointed snout. The eyes are very large and lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The five pairs of gill slits are long, extending onto the dorsal surface. The sizable, arched jaws can be protruded almost to the tip of the snout and contain large teeth, shaped like spikes in the front and knives on the sides. There are fewer than 30 tooth rows in either jaw; in the upper jaw, the first two large teeth are separated from the lateral teeth by a row of small intermediate teeth.\n\nThe pectoral fins are small, broad, and rounded. The pelvic fins are nearly as large as the pectorals. The first dorsal fin is small, low and angular; the second dorsal fin is smaller than the first but larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical with a moderately long upper lobe. The caudal peduncle is slightly compressed with weak lateral keels. The dermal denticles are small, with a flattened crown bearing small ridges and backward-pointing cusps It is dark brown above and paler below, sometimes with a few dark blotches on the sides and belly and/or a white blotch between the corner of the mouth and the first gill slit. The fins have thin translucent to white margins. The crocodile shark grows to a maximum length of 1.1 m (3.6 ft). Most individuals are 1 m (3.3 ft) long and weigh 4–6 kg (8.8–13.2 lb).\n\nThe crocodile shark is almost circumtropical in distribution. In the Atlantic Ocean, it is known from off Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Angola, South Africa, and Saint Helena Island, though it has not yet been reported from the northwestern Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs in the Mozambique Channel and possibly the Agulhas Current and the Bay of Bengal. In the Pacific, it occurs from Japan, Taiwan, and the Korean Peninsula in the northwest, southward to Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand, and eastward to the western coast of the Americas from Baja California to Chile, including the Marshall, Phoenix, Palmyra, Johnston, Marquesas, Line, and Hawaiian Islands in between. In New Zealand this species has been recorded at the Three Kings Ridge, off the coast of Northland and on the northern Kermadec Ridge.\n\nFrom distribution records, the crocodile shark's range seems to be bound by the latitudes 37°N and 44°S, where the average sea surface temperature is 20 °C (68 °F). This species is not evenly distributed but is rather locally abundant in certain areas, suggesting that it is not strongly migratory. The crocodile shark is usually found in the pelagic zone from the surface to a depth of 590 m (1,940 ft). It is occasionally encountered inshore near the bottom and has been known to strand on the beaches of South Africa, possibly after being stunned by upwellings of cold water. In March 2017, one crocodile shark washed ashore dead off the coast of Devon, England in Hope Cove, the first ever seen off the coasts of the United Kingdom. Thus far, it remains unknown as to why this particular shark was present so far north of its normal range.\n\nWith a long body, small fins, and large liver rich in squalene and other low-density lipids, the crocodile shark is convergently similar to mesopelagic dogfish sharks such as the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). The liver may comprise a fifth of the shark's weight, and acts as an incompressible float that allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with little effort. Like many other inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone, the crocodile shark apparently migrates closer to the surface at night to feed and descends into deeper water during the day, being rarely found above a depth of 200 m (660 ft) during daytime.\n\nThe large eyes of the crocodile shark, equipped with a reflective green or yellow retina and lacking an expanded iris, suggest that it is a nocturnal hunter that relies on sight to pick out the silhouettes or bioluminescence of its prey. Little is known of the crocodile shark's feeding habits; it is thought to be an active, fast-swimming predator based on its strong musculature, large tail, and behavior when captured. On one occasion, a crocodile shark off Cape Point, South Africa, jumped out of the water in pursuit of bait. Its diet consists of small to medium-sized bony fishes (including bristlemouths and lanternfishes), squid (including onychoteuthids, mastigoteuthids, pholidoteuthids, and cranchiids) and shrimp. Crocodile sharks are not known to be preyed upon by any other species.\n\nThe crocodile shark is aplacental viviparous and typically gives birth to litters of four, two pups to each uterus. The gestation period is unknown but believed to be long. The embryos have yolk sacs at 3–4 cm (1.2–1.6 in) long; once the yolk sac is fully absorbed they become oophagous: the mother produces large numbers of thin-walled egg capsules that contain 2–9 eggs each, which are then consumed by the unborn embryos. The abdomens of the embryos become characteristically distended with ingested yolk material, which can make up a quarter of the embryo's total weight. It is unclear how two crocodile shark fetuses manage to share a single uterus, when in some other oophagous mackerel sharks such as the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), only one fetus survives in each uterus. The pups are born at approximately 40 cm (16 in) long; males attain maturity at 74–110 cm (29–43.5 in) and females at 89–102 cm (35–40 in). There is no defined reproductive season.\n\nWith its small size, non-cutting teeth, and oceanic habitat, the crocodile shark is not considered dangerous to humans. However, it has a powerful bite that invites caution. This species is a common bycatch of various pelagic longline fisheries meant for tuna and swordfish. The largest numbers are caught by the Japanese yellowfin tuna fishery and the Australian swordfish fishery, both operating in the Indian Ocean. This species is also sometimes caught on squid jigs and in tuna gillnets. It is usually discarded due to its small size and low-quality meat. However, its oily liver is potentially valuable. No data is available on the population status of the crocodile shark, though it is probably declining from bycatch mortality. Coupled with its low reproductive rate, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assessed it as Near Threatened. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the crocodile shark as \"Data Deficient\" with the qualifier \"Secure Overseas\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.\n\nAfter AT&T installed the first deep sea fiberoptic cables between Gran Canaria and Tenerife in the Canary Islands in September 1985, the system suffered a series of shorts that necessitated costly repairs. It was discovered that attacks from the crocodile shark were responsible for most of the failures, possibly because they were attracted to the electric field around the cables. Since crocodile sharks are not benthic in nature, they were presumably biting the cables as they were being deployed. The problem was solved by protecting the cables with a layer of steel tape beneath a dense polyethylene coating.",

These spiders originated in Europe, have been observed as south as the Mediterranean Coast and as north as Finland, and have been introduced to North America. They are often found on bridges, especially near light and over water. The species tends to live on steel objects and is seldom seen on vegetation. Females reach a body length of 10–14 mm, and males 8–9 mm. Their orb webs can have diameters of up to 70 cm.\n\nL. sclopetarius is attracted to light. Spiders found near light sources may be in better condition and have greater reproductive success than spiders living in unlit areas. Most of these lighted areas are found in cities or other metropolitan areas. As a result, many urban areas have become saturated with these spiders. As many as 100 of these spiders can be found in a square meter in optimal feeding locations.\n\nL. sclopetarius often hide during the day, and wait for prey in the center of their web at night. In high-density populations, spiders may remain sedentary to protect their territories. Mature females and juvenile spiders will often build webs. However, adult males generally inhabit adult female webs. Males can be found mostly during summer, while females are active until November in Central Europe.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The common name “bridge-spider” is attributed to its preferential habitat of building webs on bridges.\n\nLariniodes sclopetarius was first recorded by Carl Clerck in 1757. The genus Lariniodes indicates that they create large noticeable orb webs.\n\nThere has been some dispute in how the spider should be classified. The spider has been proposed as a synonym for L. cornutus due to their similar male pedipalps. However, their habitats vary greatly. This finding has been used as evidence that these two species are distinct.\n\nL. sclopetarius exhibit a slight sexual dimorphism, where females are heavier than males. Females typically weigh around 60 mg, whereas males weigh around 38 mg. However, males may be slightly larger than females. Females can range from 4.5- 6.25 mm in length. Males vary from 4.25 mm -7 mm in length.\n\nL. sclopetarius differs from its close relatives, L. patagiatus and L. cornutus, with a few defining characteristics. Unlike the latter two species, L. sclopetarius has white hairs that provide a silhouette for their heads and dark markings on its abdomen.\n\nL. sclopetarius shows high plasticity levels based on resource availability. These spiders exhibit variability in growth and weight gain between molting-periods. Their intermolt periods have a broader range of values than other spiders that inhabit urban environments such as Zygiella x‐notata.\n\nAdditionally, L. sclopetarius can alter its growth rate without increasing its risk of mortality. In resource-abundant areas, spiders have exhibited accelerated maturation. Their fast growth rates may allow them to colonize areas that can accommodate them.\n\nIn North America L. sclopetarius is most common in the Great Lakes states, but can be found throughout the country. It is mostly found near buildings. L. sclopetarius is also found in Central Europe, often near water. They are also most commonly found near artificial sources of light near water bodies such as bridges and boats. They often aggregate in high densities near light sources. The lights tend to attract more insects which increases the spider's prey capture. Their light-seeking behaviors may have some genetic basis.\n\nIn these feeding-locations, adult females tend to occupy the best foraging areas. Juveniles and immature spiders are relegated to worse feeding areas when competition is high. These behaviors may be observed because to juveniles are unable to compete for better territories. However, when these spiders mature, they often search for more illuminated areas to create their webs and lay their eggs.\n\nL. sclopetarius is not a social spider. However, they often build webs next to each other. Females exhibit territorial defense of their webs from intruders, including other members of the same species. In high population densities, females exhibit more aggressive behavior to conspecifics due to the shortages of territories.\n\nThese spiders are primarily nocturnal foragers. Their prey capture fluctuates with the seasons. Their prey capture is highest in the summer months, declining in the spring and fall. Chironomids consist of a significant portion of their diet. These small flies may comprise up to 94% of the spiders’ diets. Their prey's average size ranges from 1.2 to 6.8 mm.\n\nL. sclopetarius creates circular orb webs unlike other orb-web spiders that construct elliptical orb webs. Additionally, their orb-webs change in shape as the spider ages. As the spider matures, the adhesive web's lower-section will continue to increase whereas the web's upper section will become proportionally smaller. This discrepancy in web-size becomes more prominent as the spider gets larger. Spiders in high-prey areas create webs with larger capture areas. These trends differ from other spiders such as A. keyserlingi where satiated spiders created smaller webs.\n\nL. sclopetarius creates webs near sources of light. The part of the web adjacent to the light captures more prey than parts of the web farther away from the light .\n\nWhen resting in webs, these spiders tend to orient their posteriors in the direction of the wind. When the direction of the wind changes, the spider attempts to position itself back towards it. This behavior may have evolved to reduce the spider's risk of being blown off the web's hub. Adhering to webs may be a challenge for L. sclopetarius in urban environments due to the lack of areas that can accommodate stable web sites under windy conditions.\n\nAdults create asymmetrical webs. The outer frame threads are generally similar in structure. The hubs, which are centers of the web, are also comparable to each other. The difference lies in the radii of the capture threads. The lower region radii of the capture threads are larger than the upper regions of the web. The web's unequal sizes may be due to the spider's easier accessibility to the captured prey in the lower regions of the web. This capture web asymmetry increases with spider weight and becomes more pronounced as the spiders age. Unlike adults, juveniles create symmetrical webs.\n\nThe mean mesh height - the distance between different capture threads - is approximately 2 mm. Unlike many other spiders, L. sclopetarius does not follow the trend of greater mesh height equating to capturing larger prey. One explanation may be the lack of prey diversity. Regardless of mesh height, L. sclopetarius primarily targets smaller dipterans.\n\nL. sclopetarius spiders live for approximately 1.5 years under optimal conditions. Females have an above average reproductive ability producing up to 15 egg sacs. Males typically grow faster than females and mature into adults up to a month earlier.\n\nUnlike many spiders, development is independent of the seasons. Adult spiders may mature at any point during the year, however the greatest concentration of mature spiders occurs in late Summer.\n\nAssortative mating may be at play, as aggressive males and females are more likely to mate with each other. Additionally, non-aggressive individuals are more likely to mate with each other. Aggression may be selected for as it may be important for securing the best sites for web building, which are around light sources. In some instances, groups of aggressive spiders may have lower mortality rates than mixed groups with non-aggressive and aggressive spiders.\n\nAggressive males tend to create more fit males. Female reproductive success was partially dependent on female size rather than aggressiveness.\n\nFemales may eat males when resources are scarce. Females that consume insects generally absorb more lipids, which provide a more efficient energy-source. Sexual cannibalism does not seem to affect spider egg sac mass and clutch size because protein and lipid diets had elicited similar results. However, when food sources are scarce, spiderlings from females consuming high lipid diets may have better survival rates than spiderlings from females consuming high protein diets. Males may be seen as last-resort prey where there are no better options.\n\nSpiderlings from mothers who consumed male L. sclopetarius were observed spinning their webs sooner than mothers that solely ate insects. This observed behavior may either be due to the male providing necessary proteins for silk production or an environmental stressor that encouraged web building to compete in resource-scarce settings.\n\nThis spider follows Rensch's rule which states that male size is more variable than female size. There is only a small sexual dimorphism between males and females. Females grow slower and have more instars than males. As a result, they become heavier than males. Males grow faster and weigh approximately 40% of females. They also have longer legs and are larger than female spiders. These longer leg lengths may be due to mating advantages due to female choice or male competition.\n\nDiet may be related to male spider size. Poorer diets are associated with male spiders that possess shorter legs. Female spider size was unaffected by the quality of the diet. Female size may be undergoing stabilizing selection, which can explain the lack of variance in size despite diet changes.\n\nFemale spiders live independently, defending their own webs. However, male spiders may have a kleptoparasitic relationship with a female. They often choose to live on a female's web and steal their prey.\n\nL. sclopetarius exhibits high levels of activities in unfamiliar environments, which may have contributed to their widespread colonization of urban areas. In experimental conditions, they tend to move and explore new settings more than their other urban counterparts Zygiella x-notata.\n\nL. sclopetarius exhibits many aggressive behaviors such as chasing and attacking conspecifics. If individuals are in the same web, they may engage in web-shaking contests. These aggressive behaviors may be genetically inherited. Males are generally more aggressive than females (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-017-2353-x).\n\nL. sclopetarius typically positions itself on the lower areas of the web. This can be seen as a defensive behavior as it allows the spider to easily escape from the web from predators by using a safety line.\n\nL. sclopetarius moves between areas using a ballooning technique where the spider releases threads into the wind to travel. This method allows the spider to travel to preferable feeding areas.\n\nL. sclopetarius secretes anti-adhesive compounds that prevent its legs from sticking to their capture-threads. The mechanism for how these spiders develop and secrete this protection is currently unknown.\n\nMale spiders exhibit protandry. The benefits for this behavior are unknown; the number of females able to breed throughout the year is relatively constant. Other factors that encourage protandry such as mate guarding and time of mating were not seen in L. sclopetarius.\n\nPhalacrotophora epeirae is one predator that consumes L. sclopetarius eggs.\n\nTrypoxylon attenuatum is a species of spider hunting wasp exhibited to hunt L. sclopetarius. These wasps are normally found in Southern Europe and prey on both foraging and sedentary spiders. T. attenuatum will paralyze spiders and bring them back to their nests. Once at the nest, L. sclopetarius may have an egg laid in it and serve as a food source for the wasp's larvae.\n\nL. sclopetarius has been found in urban environments aggregating around light sources. In Finland, they have been found in boats and boathouses. These spiders can migrate via boats which have caused them to be found in isolated islands such as the Åland Islands and spread over much of coastal Europe. One restaurant boat owner said the staff needed to get rid of webs every morning as they were driving away customers.\n\nThe annual migration of Larinioides sclopetarius is notable in Chicago, where ballooning spiders attach themselves to high rise buildings. L. sclopetarius webs serve as a balloon to move through air currents till they find an ideal location to construct their new webs. This usually causes panic with people. However, this is a common occurrence especially in high rise buildings because these spiders prefer higher ground. Because of this, L. sclopetarius prefers to reside along hotel windows, due to the added benefit of bright lights for insect prey to get trapped in their webs.\n\nEven when these spiders are present together in large numbers, they typically do not bite humans. L. sclopetarius is venomous, however the effect of the venom ranges from the potency of a mosquito-bite to the sting of a honeybee. If they do bite, it is when their webs are threatened, and the bite is usually superficial and heals quickly without much need for medical help.",

Catfish belong to a superorder called the Ostariophysi, which also includes the Cypriniformes (carps and minnows), Characiformes (characins and tetras), Gonorynchiformes (milkfish and beaked salmons) and Gymnotiformes (South American knifefish), a superorder characterized by the Weberian apparatus. Some place Gymnotiformes as a sub-order of Siluriformes; however, this is not as widely accepted. Currently, the Siluriformes are said to be the sister group to the Gymnotiformes, though this has been debated due to more recent molecular evidence.

This makes the catfish order the second or third most diverse vertebrate order; in fact, one out of every twenty vertebrate species is a catfish.\n\nCatfish are believed to have a Gondwanan origin primarily centered around South America, as the most basal living catfish groups are known from there.

A potential fossil record is known from the earlier Coniacian-Santonian stages in Niger of West Africa, though this has been considered unreliable, and the putative earliest armored catfish known from the fossil record, Afrocascudo, lived during the Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous in Morocco of North Africa (Kem Kem Group). The describers of Afrocascudo claimed that the presence of a derived loricariid so early on would indicate the extensive diversification of catfish, or at least loricarioids, prior to the beginning of the Late Cretaceous. As extant loricariids are only known from South America, much of this diversification must have occurred on the supercontinent of West Gondwana prior to its fragmentation into South America and Africa. Britz and colleagues suggested that Afrocascudo instead represents a juvenile obaichthyid lepisosteiform, possibly a junior synonym of Obaichthys. The authors of the original study still stood by their original conclusion based on the absence of important holostean characters, and noted that it could not be a juvenile, since the bones were completely ossified.\n\nThe taxonomy of catfish is quickly changing. In a 2007 and 2008 paper, Horabagrus, Phreatobius, and Conorhynchos were not classified under any current catfish families. There is disagreement on the family status of certain groups; for example, Nelson (2006) lists Auchenoglanididae and Heteropneustidae as separate families, while the All Catfish Species Inventory (ACSI) includes them under other families. FishBase and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System lists Parakysidae as a separate family, while this group is included under Akysidae by both Nelson (2006) and ACSI. Many sources do not list the recently revised family Anchariidae. The family Horabagridae, including Horabagrus, Pseudeutropius, and Platytropius, is not shown by some authors but presented by others as a true group. Thus, the actual number of families differs between authors. The species count is in constant flux due to taxonomic work as well as description of new species. Between 2003 and 2005, over one hundred species were named, a rate three times faster than that of the past century. In June 2005, researchers named the newest family of catfish, Lacantuniidae, only the third new family of fish distinguished in the last seventy years, the others being the coelacanth in 1938 and the megamouth shark in 1983. The new species in Lacantuniidae, Lacantunia enigmatica, was found in the Lacantun river in the Mexican state of Chiapas.\n\nThe higher-level phylogeny of Siluriformes has gone through several recent changes, mainly due to molecular phylogenetic studies. While most studies, both morphological and molecular, agree that catfishes are arranged into three main lineages, the relationship among these lineages has been a contentious point in which these studies, performed for example by Rui Diogo, differ. The three main lineages in Siluriformes are the family Diplomystidae, the denticulate catfish suborder Loricarioidei (containing the Neotropical \"suckermouth\" catfishes), and the suborder Siluroidei, which contains the remaining families of the order. According to morphological data, Diplomystidae is usually considered to be the earliest branching catfish lineage and the sister group to the other two lineages, Loricarioidei and Siluroidei. Molecular evidence usually contrasts with this hypothesis, and shows the suborder Loricarioidei as the earliest branching catfish lineage, and sister to a clade that includes the Diplomystidae and Siluroidei; this phylogeny has been obtained in numerous studies based on genetic data. However, it has been suggested that these molecular results are errors as a result of long branch attraction, incorrectly placing Loricarioidei as the earliest-branching catfish lineage. When a data filtering method was used to reduce lineage rate heterogeneity (the potential source of bias) on their dataset, a final phylogeny was recovered which showed the Diplomystidae are the earliest-branching catfish, followed by Loricarioidei and Siluroidei as sister lineages, providing both morphological and molecular support for Diplomystidae being the earliest branching catfish.\n\nBelow is a list of family relationships by different authors. Lacantuniidae is included in the Sullivan scheme based on recent evidence that places it sister to Claroteidae.\n\nPhylogeny of living Siluriformes based on 2017 and extinct families based on Nelson, Grande & Wilson 2016.\n\n†Andinichthyidae\n\nNematogenyidae\n\nTrichomycteridae\n\nCallichthyidae\n\nAstroblepidae\n\nLoricariidae\n\nDiplomystidae\n\n†Bachmanniidae\n\n†Hypsidoridae\n\nCetopsidae\n\nSiluridae\n\nPangasiidae\n\nMochokidae\n\nClaroteidae\n\nPlotosidae\n\nIctaluridae\n\nClariidae\n\nAiliidae\n\nSisoridae\n\nBagridae\n\nAspredinidae\n\nDoradidae\n\nAuchenipteridae\n\nHeptapteridae\n\nPseudopimelodidae\n\nPimelodidae\n\nUnassigned families:\n\nExtant catfish species live inland or in coastal waters of every continent except Antarctica. Catfish have inhabited all continents at one time or another. They are most diverse in tropical South America, Asia, and Africa, with one family native to North America and one family in Europe. More than half of all catfish species live in the Americas. They are the only ostariophysans that have entered freshwater habitats in Madagascar, Australia, and New Guinea.\n\nThey are found in fresh water/brackish water environments, though most inhabit shallow, running water. Representatives of at least eight families are hypogean (live underground) with three families that are also troglobitic (inhabiting caves). One such species is Phreatobius cisternarum, known to live underground in phreatic habitats. Numerous species from the families Ariidae and Plotosidae, and a few species from among the Aspredinidae and Bagridae, are found in salt water.\n\nIn the Southern United States, catfish species may be known by a variety of slang names, such as \"mud cat\", \"polliwogs\", or \"chuckleheads\". These nicknames are not standardized, so one area may call a bullhead catfish by the nickname \"chucklehead\", while in another state or region, that nickname refers to the blue catfish.\n\nRepresentatives of the genus Ictalurus have been introduced into European waters in the hope of obtaining a sporting and food resource, but the European stock of American catfishes has not achieved the dimensions of these fish in their native waters and have only increased the ecological pressure on native European fauna. Walking catfish have also been introduced in the freshwater areas of Florida, with the voracious catfish becoming a major alien pest there. Flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris, is also a North American pest on Atlantic slope drainages. Pterygoplichthys species, released by aquarium fishkeepers, have also established feral populations in many warm waters around the world.\n\nMost catfish are bottom feeders. In general, they are negatively buoyant, which means that they usually sink rather than float due to a reduced gas bladder and a heavy, bony head. Catfish have a variety of body shapes, though most have a cylindrical body with a flattened ventrum to allow for benthic feeding.\n\nA flattened head allows for digging through the substrate, as well as perhaps serving as a hydrofoil. Some have a mouth that can expand to a large size and contains no incisiform teeth; catfish generally feed through suction or gulping rather than biting and cutting prey. Some families, though, notably the Loricariidae and Astroblepidae, have a suckermouth that allows them to fasten themselves to objects in fast-moving water. Catfish also have a maxilla reduced to a support for barbels; this means that they are unable to protrude their mouths as other fish such as carp.\n\nCatfish may have up to four pairs of barbels - nasal, maxillary (on each side of mouth), and two pairs of chin barbels, though pairs of barbels may be absent depending on the species. Catfish barbels always occur in pairs. Many larger catfish also have chemoreceptors across their entire bodies, which means they \"taste\" anything they touch and \"smell\" any chemicals in the water. \"In catfish, gustation plays a primary role in the orientation and location of food\". Because their barbels and chemoreception are more important in detecting food, the eyes on catfish are generally small. Like other ostariophysans, they are characterized by the presence of a Weberian apparatus. Their well-developed Weberian apparatus and reduced gas bladder allow for improved hearing and sound production.\n\nCatfish do not have scales; their bodies are often naked. In some species, their mucus-covered skin is used in cutaneous respiration, where the fish breathes through its skin. In some catfish, the skin is covered in bony plates called scutes; some form of body armor appears in various ways within the order. In loricarioids and in the Asian genus Sisor, the armor is primarily made up of one or more rows of free dermal plates. Similar plates are found in large specimens of Lithodoras. These plates may be supported by vertebral processes, as in scoloplacids and in Sisor, but the processes never fuse to the plates or form any external armor. By contrast, in the subfamily Doumeinae (family Amphiliidae) and in hoplomyzontines (Aspredinidae), the armor is formed solely by expanded vertebral processes that form plates. Finally, the lateral armor of doradids, Sisor, and hoplomyzontines consists of hypertrophied lateral line ossicles with dorsal and ventral lamina.\n\nAll catfish other than members of the Malapteruridae (electric catfish), possess a strong, hollow, bony, leading spine-like ray on their dorsal and pectoral fins. As a defense, these spines may be locked into place so that they stick outwards, enabling them to inflict severe wounds. In numerous catfish species, these fin rays can be used to deliver a stinging protein if the fish is irritated; as many as half of all catfish species may be venomous in this fashion, making the Siluriformes overwhelmingly the vertebrate order with the largest number of venomous species. This venom is produced by glandular cells in the epidermal tissue covering the spines. In members of the family Plotosidae and of the genus Heteropneustes, this protein is so strong it may hospitalize humans who receive a sting; in Plotosus lineatus, the stings can be lethal. The dorsal- and pectoral-fin spines are two of the most conspicuous features of siluriforms, and differ from those in other fish groups. Despite the widespread use of the spines for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies the fields have struggled to effectively use the information due to a lack of consistency in the nomenclature, with a general standard for the descriptive anatomy of catfish spines proposed in 2022 to try and resolve this problem.\n\nJuvenile catfish, like most fish, have relatively large heads, eyes, and posterior median fins in comparison to larger, more mature individuals. These juveniles can be readily placed in their families, particularly those with highly derived fin or body shapes; in some cases, identification of the genus is possible. As far as known for most catfish, features that are often characteristic of species, such as mouth and fin positions, fin shapes, and barbel lengths, show little difference between juveniles and adults. For many species, pigmentation pattern is also similar in juveniles and adults. Thus, juvenile catfish generally resemble and develop smoothly into their adult form without distinct juvenile specializations. Exceptions to this are the ariid catfish, where the young retain yolk sacs late into juvenile stages, and many pimelodids, which may have elongated barbels and fin filaments or coloration patterns.\n\nSexual dimorphism is reported in about half of all families of catfish. The modification of the anal fin into an intromittent organ (in internal fertilizers) as well as accessory structures of the reproductive apparatus (in both internal and external fertilizers) have been described in species belonging to 11 different families.\n\nCatfish have one of the largest ranges in size within a single order of bony fish. Many catfish have a maximum length of under 12 cm (4.7 in). Some of the smallest species of the Aspredinidae and Trichomycteridae reach sexual maturity at only 1 cm (0.39 in).\n\nThe wels catfish, Silurus glanis, and the much smaller related Aristotle's catfish, are the only catfish indigenous to Europe; the former ranges throughout Europe, and the latter is restricted to Greece. Mythology and literature record wels catfish of astounding proportions yet are to be proven scientifically. The typical size of the species is about 1.2–1.6 m (3.9–5.2 ft), and fish more than 2 m (6.6 ft) are rare. However, they are known to exceed 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in length and 100 kg (220 lb) in weight. In July 2009, a catfish weighing 88 kilograms (194 lb) was caught in the River Ebro, Spain, by an 11-year-old British schoolgirl.\n\nIn North America, the largest Ictalurus furcatus (blue catfish) caught in the Missouri River on 20 July 2010, weighed 59 kg (130 lb). The largest flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris, ever caught was in Independence, Kansas, weighing 56 kg (123 lb).\n\nThese records pale in comparison to a Mekong giant catfish caught in northern Thailand on 1 May 2005, and reported to the press almost 2 months later, that weighed 293 kilograms (646 lb). This is the largest giant Mekong catfish caught since Thai officials started keeping records in 1981. Also in Asia, Jeremy Wade caught a 75.5-kilogram (166.4 lb) goonch following three fatal attacks on humans in the Kali River on the India-Nepal border. Wade was of the opinion that the offending fish must have been significantly larger than this to have taken an 18-year-old boy, as well as a water buffalo.[citation needed]\n\nPiraíba (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum) can grow exceptionally large and are native to the Amazon Basin. They can occasionally grow to 200 kg (440 lb), as evidenced by numerous catches. Deaths from being swallowed by these fish have been reported in the region.\n\nIn many catfish, the \"humeral process\" is a bony process extending backward from the pectoral girdle immediately above the base of the pectoral fin. It lies beneath the skin, where its outline may be determined by dissecting the skin or probing with a needle.\n\nThe retinae of catfish are composed of single cones and large rods. Many catfish have a tapetum lucidum, which may help enhance photon capture and increase low-light sensitivity. Double cones, though present in most teleosts, are absent from catfish.\n\nThe anatomical organization of the testis in catfish is variable among the families of catfish, but the majority of them present fringed testis: Ictaluridae, Claridae, Auchenipteridae, Doradidae, Pimelodidae, and Pseudopimelodidae. In the testes of some species of Siluriformes, organs and structures such as a spermatogenic cranial region and a secretory caudal region are observed, in addition to the presence of seminal vesicles in the caudal region. The total number of fringes and their length are different in the caudal and cranial portions between species. Fringes of the caudal region may present tubules, in which the lumen is filled by secretion and spermatozoa. Spermatocysts are formed from cytoplasmic extensions of Sertoli cells; the release of spermatozoa is allowed by breaking of the cyst walls.\n\nThe occurrence of seminal vesicles, in spite of their interspecific variability in size, gross morphology, and function, has not been related to the mode of fertilization. They are typically paired, multichambered, and connected with the sperm duct, and have been reported to play glandular and storage functions. Seminal vesicle secretion may include steroids and steroid glucuronides, with hormonal and pheromonal functions, but it appears to be primarily constituted of mucoproteins, acid mucopolysaccharides, and phospholipids.\n\nFish ovaries may be of two types - gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then eliminated. In the second type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Many catfish are cystovarian in type, including Pseudoplatystoma corruscans, P. fasciatum, Lophiosilurus alexandri, and Loricaria lentiginosa.\n\nCatfish can produce different types of sounds and also have well-developed auditory reception used to discriminate between sounds with different pitches and velocities. They are also able to determine the distance of the sound's origin and from what direction it originated. This is a very important fish communication mechanism, especially during agonistic and distress behaviors. Catfish are able to produce a variety of sounds for communication that can be classified into two groups: drumming sounds and stridulation sounds. The variability in catfish sound signals differs due to a few factors: the mechanism by which the sound is produced, the function of the resulting sound, and physiological differences such as size, sex, and age. To create a drumming sound, catfish use an indirect vibration mechanism using a swimbladder. In these fishes, sonic muscles insert on the ramus Mulleri, also known as the elastic spring. The sonic muscles pull the elastic spring forward and extend the swimbladder. When the muscles relax, the tension in the spring quickly returns the swimbladder to its original position, which produces the sound.\n\nCatfish also have a sound-generating mechanism in their pectoral fins. Many species in the catfish family possess an enhanced first pectoral fin ray, called the spine, which can be moved by large abductor and adductor muscles. The base of the catfishes' spines has a sequence of ridges, and the spine normally slides within a groove on the fish's pelvic girdle during routine movement; but, pressing the ridges on the spine against the pelvic girdle groove creates a series of short pulses. The movement is analogous to a finger moving down the teeth of a comb, and consequently a series of sharp taps is produced.\n\nSound-generating mechanisms are often different between the sexes. In some catfish, pectoral fins are longer in males than in females of similar length, and differences in the characteristic of the sounds produced were also observed. Comparison between families of the same order of catfish demonstrated family and species-specific patterns of vocalization, according to a study by Maria Clara Amorim. During courtship behavior in three species of Corydoras catfish, all males actively produced stridulation sounds before egg fertilization, and the species' songs were different in pulse number and sound duration.\n\nSound production in catfish may also be correlated with fighting and alarm calls. According to a study by Kaatz, sounds for disturbance (e.g. alarm) and agonistic behavior were not significantly different, which suggests distress sounds can be used to sample variation in agonistic sound production. However, in a comparison of a few different species of tropical catfish, some fish put under distress conditions produced a higher intensity of stridulatory sounds than drumming sounds. Differences in the proportion of drumming versus stridulation sounds depend on morphological constraints, such as different sizes of drumming muscles and pectoral spines. Due to these constraints, some fish may not even be able to produce a specific sound. In several different species of catfish, aggressive sound production occurs during cover site defense or during threats from other fish. More specifically, in long-whiskered catfish, drumming sounds are used as a threatening signal and stridulations are used as a defense signal. Kaatz investigated 83 species from 14 families of catfish, and determined that catfish produce more stridulatory sounds in disturbance situations and more swimbladder sounds in intraspecific conflicts.\n\nCatfish are easy to farm in warm climates, leading to inexpensive and safe food at local grocers. About 60% of U.S. farm-raised catfish are grown within a 65-mile (100-km) radius of Belzoni, Mississippi. Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) supports a $450 million/yr aquaculture industry. The largest producers are located in the Southern United States, including Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.\n\nCatfish raised in inland tanks or channels are usually considered safe for the environment, since their waste and disease should be contained and not spread to the wild.\n\nIn Asia, many catfish species are important as food. Several airbreathing catfish (Clariidae) and shark catfish (Pangasiidae) species are heavily cultured in Africa and Asia. Exports of one particular shark catfish species from Vietnam, Pangasius bocourti, have met with pressures from the U.S. catfish industry. In 2003, The United States Congress passed a law preventing the imported fish from being labeled as catfish. As a result, the Vietnamese exporters of this fish now label their products sold in the U.S. as \"basa fish.\" Trader Joe's has labeled frozen fillets of Vietnamese Pangasius hypophthalmus as \"striper.\"\n\nThere is a large and growing ornamental fish trade, with hundreds of species of catfish, such as Corydoras and armored suckermouth catfish (often called plecos), being a popular component of many aquaria. Other catfish commonly found in the aquarium trade are banjo catfish, talking catfish, and long-whiskered catfish.\n\nCatfish have widely been caught and farmed for food for thousands of years in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Judgments as to the quality and flavor vary, with some food critics considering catfish excellent to eat, while others dismiss them as watery and lacking in flavor. Catfish is high in vitamin D. Farm-raised catfish contains low levels of omega-3 fatty acids and a much higher proportion of omega-6 fatty acids.\n\nIn Central Europe, catfish were often viewed as a delicacy to be enjoyed on feast days and holidays. Migrants from Europe and Africa to the United States brought along this tradition, and in the Southern United States, catfish is an extremely popular food.\n\nThe most commonly eaten species in the United States are the channel catfish and the blue catfish, both of which are common in the wild and increasingly widely farmed. Farm-raised catfish became such a staple of the U.S. diet that President Ronald Reagan proclaimed National Catfish Day on June 25, 1987, to recognize \"the value of farm-raised catfish.\"\n\nCatfish is eaten in a variety of ways. In Europe, it is often cooked in similar ways to carp, but in the United States it is popularly crumbed with cornmeal and fried.\n\nIn Indonesia, catfish is usually served fried or grilled in street stalls called warung and eaten with vegetables, sambal (a spicy relish or sauce), and usually nasi uduk (traditional coconut rice). The dish is called pecel lele or pecak lele. Lele is the Indonesian word for catfish. The same dish can also be called as lele penyet (squashed catfish) if the fish is lightly squashed along with sambal with a stone mortar-and-pestle. The pecel or pecak version presents the fish in a separate plate while the mortar is solely for sambal.\n\nIn Malaysia, catfish is called ikan keli and is fried with spices or grilled and eaten with tamarind and Thai chili gravy and is also often eaten with steamed rice.\n\nIn Bangladesh and the Indian states of Odisha, West Bengal and Assam, catfish (locally known as magur) is eaten as a favored delicacy during the monsoons. In the Indian state of Kerala, the local catfish, known as thedu' or etta in Malayalam, is also popular.\n\nIn Hungary, catfish is often cooked in paprika sauce (Harcsapaprikás) typical of Hungarian cuisine. It is traditionally served with pasta smothered with curd cheese (túrós csusza).\n\nIn Myanmar (formally Burma), catfish is usually used in mohinga, a traditional noodle fish soup cooked with lemon grass, ginger, garlic, pepper, banana stem, onions, and other local ingredients.\n\nVietnamese catfish, of the genus Pangasius, cannot be legally marketed as catfish in the United States, and so is referred to as swai or basa. Only fish of the family Ictaluridae may be marketed as catfish in the United States. In the UK, Vietnamese catfish is sometimes sold as \"Vietnamese river cobbler\", although more commonly as Basa.\n\nIn Nigeria, catfish is often cooked in a variety of stews. It is particularly cooked in a delicacy popularly known as \"catfish pepper soup\" which is enjoyed throughout the nation.\n\nIn Jewish dietary law, known as kashrut, fish must have fins and scales to be kosher. Since catfish lack scales, they are not kosher.\n\nIn the mythology of the Japanese Shinto religion natural phenomenon are caused by kami. Earthquakes are caused by a giant catfish called Namazu. There are other kami associated with earthquakes. In Kyoto it's usually an eel, but after the 1855 Edo earthquake Namazu-e (鯰絵, \"catfish prints\") were printed giving more popularity to the catfish kami that has been known since the 16th century Otsu-e. In one catfish print the divine white horse of Amaterasu is depicted knocking down the earthquake-causing catfish.\n\nWhile the vast majority of catfish are harmless to humans, a few species are known to present some risk. Many catfish species have \"stings\" (actually non-venomous in most cases) embedded behind their fins; thus precautions must be taken when handling them. Stings by the venomous striped eel catfish have killed people in rare cases.\n\nBy information from International Game Fish Association IGFA the most outstanding record:",

      "introduction":"\n\n†AdapiformesLemuriformes[a] (See text)\n\nsister: Haplorhini\n\nStrepsirrhini or Strepsirhini (/ˌstrɛpsəˈraɪni/ ⓘ; STREP-sə-RY-nee) is a suborder of primates that includes the lemuriform primates, which consist of the lemurs of Madagascar, galagos (\"bushbabies\") and pottos from Africa, and the lorises from India and southeast Asia.[a] Collectively they are referred to as strepsirrhines. Also belonging to the suborder are the extinct adapiform primates which thrived during the Eocene in Europe, North America, and Asia, but disappeared from most of the Northern Hemisphere as the climate cooled. Adapiforms are sometimes referred to as being \"lemur-like\", although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms does not support this comparison.\n\nStrepsirrhines are defined by their \"wet\" (moist) rhinarium (the tip of the snout) – hence the colloquial but inaccurate term \"wet-nosed\" – similar to the rhinaria of canines and felines. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large olfactory lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, lower part of the mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming.\n\nMany of today's living strepsirrhines are endangered due to habitat destruction, hunting for bushmeat, and live capture for the exotic pet trade. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines are behaviorally diverse, although all are primarily arboreal (tree-dwelling). Most living lemuriforms are nocturnal, while most adapiforms were diurnal. Both living and extinct groups primarily fed on fruit, leaves, and insects.",

      "sections":"The taxonomic name Strepsirrhini derives from the Greek στρέψις strepsis \"a turning round\" and ῥίς rhis \"nose, snout, (in pl.) nostrils\" (GEN ῥινός rhinos), which refers to the appearance of the sinuous (comma-shaped) nostrils on the rhinarium or wet nose. The name was first used by French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1812 as a subordinal rank comparable to Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (Old World monkeys). In his description, he mentioned \"Les narines terminales et sinueuses\" (\"Nostrils terminal and winding\").\n\nWhen British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock revived Strepsirrhini and defined Haplorhini in 1918, he omitted the second \"r\" from both (\"Strepsirhini\" and \"Haplorhini\" instead of \"Strepsirrhini\" and \"Haplorrhini\"), although he did not remove the second \"r\" from Platyrrhini or Catarrhini, both of which were also named by É. Geoffroy in 1812. Following Pocock, many researchers continued to spell Strepsirrhini with a single \"r\" until primatologists Paulina Jenkins and Prue Napier pointed out the error in 1987.\n\nStrepsirrhines include the extinct adapiforms and the lemuriform primates, which include lemurs and lorisoids (lorises, pottos, and galagos). Strepsirrhines diverged from the haplorhine primates near the beginning of the primate radiation between 55 and 90 mya. Older divergence dates are based on genetic analysis estimates, while younger dates are based on the scarce fossil record. Lemuriform primates may have evolved from either cercamoniines or sivaladapids, both of which were adapiforms that may have originated in Asia. They were once thought to have evolved from adapids, a more specialized and younger branch of adapiform primarily from Europe.\n\nScandentia (treeshrews)\n\nDermoptera (colugos)\n\n†Plesiadapiformes\n\nSimians\n\nTarsiers\n\n†Omomyiformes\n\n†Adapiformes\n\nLorisoids\n\nLemurs\n\nLemurs rafted from Africa to Madagascar between 47 and 54 mya, whereas the lorises split from the African galagos around 40 mya and later colonized Asia. The lemuriforms, and particularly the lemurs of Madagascar, are often portrayed inappropriately as \"living fossils\" or as examples of \"basal\", or \"inferior\" primates. These views have historically hindered the understanding of mammalian evolution and the evolution of strepsirrhine traits, such as their reliance on smell (olfaction), characteristics of their skeletal anatomy, and their brain size, which is relatively small. In the case of lemurs, natural selection has driven this isolated population of primates to diversify significantly and fill a rich variety of ecological niches, despite their smaller and less complex brains compared to simians.\n\nThe divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved. Although few fossils of living primate groups – lemuriforms, tarsiers, and simians – are known from the Early to Middle Eocene, evidence from genetics and recent fossil finds both suggest they may have been present during the early adaptive radiation.\n\nThe origin of the earliest primates that the simians and tarsiers both evolved from is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they emerged are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics (where primates most likely first developed) is very sparse, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades[b] of eutherian mammals first appeared.\n\nLacking detailed tropical fossils, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages and the amount of time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90 mya, nearly 40 million years before the first examples appear in the fossil record.\n\nThe early primates include both nocturnal and diurnal small-bodied species, and all were arboreal, with hands and feet specially adapted for maneuvering on small branches. Plesiadapiforms from the early Paleocene are sometimes considered \"archaic primates\", because their teeth resembled those of early primates and because they possessed adaptations to living in trees, such as a divergent big toe (hallux). Although plesiadapiforms were closely related to primates, they may represent a paraphyletic group from which primates may or may not have directly evolved, and some genera may have been more closely related to colugos,[c] which are thought to be more closely related to primates.\n\nThe first true primates (euprimates) do not appear in the fossil record until the early Eocene (~55 mya), at which point they radiated across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. These first primates included Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius, and Teilhardina on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil Altiatlasius from Paleocene Africa. These earliest fossil primates are often divided into two groups, adapiforms[d] and omomyiforms.[e] Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the Eocene.\n\nThe last branch to develop were the adapiforms, a diverse and widespread group that thrived during the Eocene (56 to 34 million years ago [mya]) in Europe, North America, and Asia. They disappeared from most of the Northern Hemisphere as the climate cooled: The last of the adapiforms died out at the end of the Miocene (~7 mya).\n\nAdapiform primates are extinct strepsirrhines that shared many anatomical similarities with lemurs. They are sometimes referred to as lemur-like primates, although the diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this analogy.\n\nLike the living strepsirrhines, adapiforms were extremely diverse, with at least 30 genera and 80 species known from the fossil record as of the early 2000s. They diversified across Laurasia during the Eocene, some reaching North America via a land bridge.They were among the most common mammals found in the fossil beds from that time. A few rare species have also been found in northern Africa. The most basal of the adapiforms include the genera Cantius from North America and Europe and Donrussellia from Europe. The latter bears the most ancestral traits, so it is often considered a sister group or stem group of the other adapiforms.\n\nAdapiforms are often divided into three major groups:\n\nThe relationship between adapiform and lemuriform primates has not been clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities to suggest that they diverged during the Paleocene (66–55 mya).\n\nLemuriform origins are unclear and debated. American paleontologist Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved from one of several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported due to a lack of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.\n\nUntil discoveries of three 40 million-year-old fossil lorisoids (Karanisia, Saharagalago, and Wadilemur) in the El Fayum deposits of Egypt between 1997 and 2005, the oldest known lemuriforms had come from the early Miocene (~20 mya) of Kenya and Uganda. These newer finds demonstrate that lemuriform primates were present during the middle Eocene in Afro-Arabia and that the lemuriform lineage and all other strepsirrhine taxa had diverged before then. Djebelemur from Tunisia dates to the late early or early middle Eocene (52 to 46 mya) and has been considered a cercamoniine, but also may have been a stem lemuriform. Azibiids from Algeria date to roughly the same time and may be a sister group of the djebelemurids. Together with Plesiopithecus from the late Eocene Egypt, the three may qualify as the stem lemuriforms from Africa.\n\nMolecular clock estimates indicate that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62 mya. Between 47 and 54 mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40 mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.\n\nThe taxonomy of strepsirrhines is controversial and has a complicated history. Confused taxonomic terminology and oversimplified anatomical comparisons have created misconceptions about primate and strepsirrhine phylogeny, illustrated by the media attention surrounding the single \"Ida\" fossil in 2009.\n\nStrepsirrhine primates were first grouped under the genus Lemur by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae published in 1758. At the time, only three species were recognized, one of which (the colugo) is no longer recognized as a primate. In 1785, Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert divided the genus Lemur into two genera: Prosimia for the lemurs, colugos, and tarsiers and Tardigradus for the lorises. Ten years later, É. Geoffroy and Georges Cuvier grouped the tarsiers and galagos due to similarities in their hindlimb morphology, a view supported by German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, who placed them in the family Macrotarsi while placing the lemurs and tarsiers in the family Prosimia (Prosimii) in 1811. The use of the tarsier-galago classification continued for many years until 1898, when Dutch zoologist Ambrosius Hubrecht demonstrated two different types of placentation (formation of a placenta) in the two groups.\n\nEnglish comparative anatomist William Henry Flower created the suborder Lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from the simians, which were grouped under English biologist St. George Jackson Mivart's suborder Anthropoidea (=Simiiformes). According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, É. Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, in which he included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared the structure of the nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times.\n\nMost of the academic literature provides a basic framework for primate taxonomy, usually including several potential taxonomic schemes. Although most experts agree upon phylogeny, many disagree about nearly every level of primate classification.\n\nThe most commonly recurring debate in primatology during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 2000s concerned the phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both simians and the other prosimians. Tarsiers are most often placed in either the suborder Haplorhini with the simians or in the suborder Prosimii with the strepsirrhines. Prosimii is one of the two traditional primate suborders and is based on evolutionary grades (groups united by anatomical traits) rather than phylogenetic clades, while the Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini taxonomy was based on evolutionary relationships. Yet both systems persist because the Prosimii-Anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in the research literature and textbooks.\n\nStrepsirrhines are traditionally characterized by several symplesiomorphic (ancestral) traits not shared with the simians, particularly the rhinarium.[f] Other symplesiomorphies include long snouts, convoluted maxilloturbinals, relatively large olfactory bulbs, and smaller brains. The toothcomb is a synapomorphy (shared, derived trait) seen among lemuriforms, although it is frequently and incorrectly used to define the strepsirrhine clade.[g] Strepsirrhine primates are also united in possessing an epitheliochorial placenta. Unlike the tarsiers and simians, strepsirrhines are capable of producing their own vitamin C and do not need it supplied in their diet. Further genetic evidence for the relationship between tarsiers and simians as a haplorhine clade is the shared possession of three SINE markers.\n\nBecause of their historically mixed assemblages which included tarsiers and close relatives of primates, both Prosimii and Strepsirrhini have been considered wastebasket taxa for \"lower primates\". Regardless, the strepsirrhine and haplorrhine clades are generally accepted and viewed as the preferred taxonomic division. Yet tarsiers still closely resemble both strepsirrhines and simians in different ways, and since the early split between strepsirrhines, tarsiers and simians is ancient and hard to resolve, a third taxonomic arrangement with three suborders is sometimes used: Prosimii, Tarsiiformes, and Anthropoidea. More often, the term \"prosimian\" is no longer used in official taxonomy, but is still used to illustrate the behavioral ecology of tarsiers relative to the other primates.\n\nIn addition to the controversy over tarsiers, the debate over the origins of simians once called the strepsirrhine clade into question. Arguments for an evolutionary link between adapiforms and simians made by paleontologists Gingerich, Elwyn L. Simons, Tab Rasmussen, and others could have potentially excluded adapiforms from Strepsirrhini. In 1975, Gingerich proposed a new suborder, Simiolemuriformes, to suggest that strepsirrhines are more closely related to simians than tarsiers. However, no clear relationship between the two had been demonstrated by the early 2000s. The idea reemerged briefly in 2009 during the media attention surrounding Darwinius masillae (dubbed \"Ida\"), a cercamoniine from Germany that was touted as a \"missing link between humans and earlier primates\" (simians and adapiforms). However, the cladistic analysis was flawed and the phylogenetic inferences and terminology were vague. Although the authors noted that Darwinius was not a \"fossil lemur\", they did emphasize the absence of a toothcomb, which adapiforms did not possess.\n\n†Adapiformes\n\nstem lemuriforms\n\nDaubentoniidae\n\nother lemurs\n\nlorises\n\ngalagos\n\nWithin Strepsirrhini, two common classifications include either two infraorders (Adapiformes and Lemuriformes) or three infraorders (Adapiformes, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes). A less common taxonomy places the aye-aye (Daubentoniidae) in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes. In some cases, plesiadapiforms are included within the order Primates, in which case Euprimates is sometimes treated as a suborder, with Strepsirrhini becoming an infraorder, and the Lemuriformes and others become parvorders. Regardless of the infraordinal taxonomy, Strepsirrhini is composed of three ranked superfamilies and 14 families, seven of which are extinct. Three of these extinct families included the recently extinct giant lemurs of Madagascar, many of which died out within the last 1,000 years following human arrival on the island.\n\nWhen Strepsirrhini is divided into two infraorders, the clade containing all toothcombed primates can be called \"lemuriforms\". When it is divided into three infraorders, the term \"lemuriforms\" refers only to Madagascar's lemurs, and the toothcombed primates are referred to as either \"crown strepsirrhines\" or \"extant strepsirrhines\". Confusion of this specific terminology with the general term \"strepsirrhine\", along with oversimplified anatomical comparisons and vague phylogenetic inferences, can lead to misconceptions about primate phylogeny and misunderstandings about primates from the Eocene, as seen with the media coverage of Darwinius. Because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as \"primitive\" strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade. Although their status as true primates is not questioned, the questionable relationship between adapiforms and other living and fossil primates leads to multiple classifications within Strepsirrhini. Often, adapiforms are placed in their own infraorder due to anatomical differences with lemuriforms and their unclear relationship. When shared traits with lemuriforms (which may or may not be synapomorphic) are emphasized, they are sometimes reduced to families within the infraorder Lemuriformes (or superfamily Lemuroidea).\n\nThe first fossil primate described was the adapiform Adapis parisiensis by French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1821, who compared it to a hyrax (\"le Daman\"), then considered a member of a now obsolete group called pachyderms. It was not recognized as a primate until it was reevaluated in the early 1870s. Originally, adapiforms were all included under the family Adapidae, which was divided into two or three subfamilies: Adapinae, Notharctinae, and sometimes Sivaladapinae. All North American adapiforms were lumped under Notharctinae, while the Old World forms were usually assigned to Adapinae. Around the 1990s, two distinct groups of European \"adapids\" began to emerge, based on differences in the postcranial skeleton and the teeth. One of these two European forms was identified as cercamoniines, which were allied with the notharctids found mostly in North America, while the other group falls into the traditional adapid classification. The three major adapiform divisions are now typically regarded as three families within Adapiformes (Notharctidae, Adapidae and Sivaladapidae), but other divisions ranging from one to five families are used as well.\n\nAll lemuriforms possess a specialized dental structure called a \"toothcomb\", with the exception of the aye-aye, in which the structure has been modified into two continually growing (hypselodont) incisors (or canine teeth), similar to those of rodents. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms.\n\nLemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. Adapiforms may have had a grooming claw, but there is little evidence of this. The toothcomb consists of either two or four procumbent lower incisors and procumbent lower canine teeth followed by a canine-shaped premolar. It is used to comb the fur during oral grooming. Shed hairs that accumulate between the teeth of the toothcomb are removed by the sublingua or \"under-tongue\". Adapiforms did not possess a toothcomb. Instead, their lower incisors varied in orientation – from somewhat procumbent to somewhat vertical – and the lower canines were projected upwards and were often prominent.\n\nLike all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a protective ring of bone created by a connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.\n\nStrepsirrhine primates have a brain relatively comparable to or slightly larger in size than most mammals. Compared to simians, however, they have a relatively small brain-to-body size ratio. Strepsirrhines are also traditionally noted for their unfused mandibular symphysis (two halves of the lower jaw), however, fusion of the mandibular symphysis was common in adapiforms, notably Notharctus. Also, several extinct giant lemurs exhibited a fused mandibular symphysis.\n\nMany nocturnal species have large, independently movable ears, although there are significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached to the edge of the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs.\n\nBoth lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery.\n\nStrepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.\n\nSexual dichromatism (different coloration patterns between males and females) can be seen in most brown lemur species, but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes. This lack of sexual dimorphism is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines. Some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic, with males bearing a larger sagittal crest (a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and canine teeth. Lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism, but males are typically no more than 20 percent larger than females.\n\nStrepsirrhines have a long snout that ends in a moist and touch-sensitive rhinarium, similar to that of dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is surrounded by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.\n\nThe surface of the rhinarium does not have any olfactory receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.\n\nThe strepsirrhine rhinarium can collect relatively non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit them to the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below and in front of the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.\n\nAll lemuriforms have a VNO, as do tarsiers and some New World monkeys. Adapiforms exhibit the gap between the upper incisors, which indicates the presence of a VNO, but there is some disagreement over whether or not they possessed a rhinarium.\n\nExtant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, where the maternal blood does not come in direct contact with the fetal chorion like it does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.\n\nMost primates have two mammary glands, but the number and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two mammary glands, but they are located near the groin (inguinal). In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.\n\nApproximately three-quarters of all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, sleeping in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their competition with the simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living in the absence of simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet some or all of the brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.\n\nReproduction in most strepsirrhine species tends to be seasonal, particularly in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include the length of the wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are thought to be plesiomorphic (ancestral) for primates. The young are precocial (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as ungulates (hoofed mammals). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the mother's fur with their hands and feet.\n\nDespite their relatively smaller brains compared to other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which may be due to adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.\n\nThe nocturnal strepsirrhines have been traditionally described as \"solitary\", although this term is no longer favored by the researchers who study them. Many are considered \"solitary foragers\", but many exhibit complex and diverse social organization, often overlapping home ranges, initiating social contact at night, and sharing sleeping sites during the day. Even the mating systems are variable, as seen in woolly lemurs, which live in monogamous breeding pairs. Because of this social diversity among these solitary but social primates, whose level of social interaction is comparable to that of diurnal simians, alternative classifications have been proposed to emphasize their gregarious, dispersed, or solitary nature.\n\nAmong extant strepsirrhines, only the diurnal and cathemeral lemurs have evolved to live in multi-male/multi-female groups, comparable to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), is thought to have evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.\n\nLike New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking for much of their communication. This involves smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained by the lack of light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.\n\nLiving strepsirrhines are predominantly arboreal, with only the ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.\n\nAnalyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons suggest a variety of locomotor behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although they may have been quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.\n\nPrimates primarily feed on fruits (including seeds), leaves (including flowers), and animal prey (arthropods, small vertebrates, and eggs). Diets vary markedly between strepsirrhine species. Like other leaf-eating (folivorous) primates, some strepsirrhines can digest cellulose and hemicellulose. Some strepsirrhines, such as the galagos, slender lorises, and angwantibos, are primarily insectivorous. Other species, such as fork-marked lemurs and needle-clawed bushbabies, specialize on tree gum, while indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs are folivores. Many strepsirrhines are frugivores (fruit eaters), and others, like the ring-tailed lemur and mouse lemurs, are omnivores, eating a mix of fruit, leaves, and animal matter.\n\nAmong the adapiforms, frugivory seems to have been the most common diet, particularly for medium-sized to large species, such as Cantius, Pelycodus and Cercamonius. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including Smilodectes, Notharctus, Adapis and Leptadapis. Sharp cusps on the teeth of some of the smaller adapiforms, such as Anchomomys and Donrussellia, indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous.\n\nThe now extinct adapiform primates were primarily found across North America, Asia, and Europe, with a few species in Africa. They flourished during the Eocene when those regions were more tropical in nature, and they disappeared when the climate became cooler and drier. Today, the lemuriforms are confined in the tropics, ranging between 28° S to 26° N latitude. Lorises are found both in equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia, while the galagos are limited to the forests and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Lemurs are endemic to Madagascar, although much of their diversity and habitat has been lost due to recent human activity.\n\nAs with nearly all primates, strepsirrhines typically reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, as many as 11 or 12 species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny forest on the southern tip of the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.\n\nLike all other non-human primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of their habitat has been converted for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: habitat destruction, hunting (for bushmeat or traditional medicine), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.\n\nIn 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced that lemurs were the \"most endangered mammals\", due largely to elevated illegal logging and hunting following a political crisis in 2009. In Southeast Asia, slow lorises are threatened by the exotic pet trade and traditional medicine, in addition to habitat destruction. Both lemurs and slow lorises are protected from commercial international trade under CITES Appendix I.",

After a courtship display, the male deposits a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. Larvae develop over after 1.5–3.5 months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles (efts). Sexual maturity is reached after two to three years, and the newts can reach a total age of up to 12 years in the wild. The species is overall common and has been assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN.",

      "sections":"The palmate newt was first described scientifically in 1789, by Russian naturalist Grigory Razumovsky. He placed it in the genus of the green lizards and named it Lacerta helvetica, with \"helvetica\" referring to the Swiss type locality in the canton of Vaud.: 111  He also gave Lacerta paradoxa as alternative name, which is today regarded as a junior synonym.: 111  Several names published over time, in different genera, are also now treated as synonyms for the palmate newt. Most recently, the species was included in the genus Triturus, along with most European newts.: 221  This genus however was found to be polyphyletic, containing several unrelated lineages, and the small-bodied newts, including the palmate newt, were therefore split off as separate genus in 2004 by García-París and colleagues.: 233  They used the genus name Lissotriton, introduced by the English zoologist Thomas Bell in 1839.: 132  Two distinct subspecies, L. h. alonsoi and L. h. punctillatus, were described from the Iberian peninsula, but have not been retained by Raffaëlli and Sparreboom.: 225\n\nPalmate newts grow to about 5–8.5 cm (2.0–3.3 in) total length in males, while females are somewhat larger and can reach 9.5 cm (3.7 in). The tail is slightly shorter than the snout–vent distance. The head is longer than wide, with three longitudinal grooves on the snout. Both sexes have an olive or brown base colour, and males and some females have dark spotting on their backs. In females, the spots can sometimes form two irregular lines, and they can have a red stripe running along the back while living on land. In both sexes, a dark stripe runs along the head through the eyes. The underside is yellow or light orange and more whitish on the sides; the belly can have some dark spots, while the throat is always unspotted. While the newts live on land, the skin is dry and velvety, but it becomes smooth when they migrate into water.: 224–225\n\nMales can be distinguished from females by the larger and darker-coloured cloaca. During the aquatic breeding season, the cloaca swells, and other sexual differences develop: Males grow a low, smooth skin seam (a crest) on their back, which is higher on the tail. Their tail has a blunt end with a distinct, 4–7 mm long filament. They also have ridges (dorso-lateral ridges) running along their sides, giving them an angular, square shape in cross-section, and their hind feet have well-developed, dark webbing. The lower half of the tail is blue in breeding males and orange in females. Development of the crest, tail filament, ridges, and webbing can be suppressed in the presence of the newts' natural predators. When exposed to predatory goldfish, newts do not express these traits, as large sexual ornaments would make them more conspicuous prey. Females do not develop a crest, tail filament or webbed feet.: 224\n\nSometimes confused with the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) which is found in much of the same area, the palmate newt can be distinguished by its unspotted throat. It also resembles Boscá's newt (L. boscai) from the Iberian peninsula, which has only a single groove on the snout and no dark eye strip.: 222\n\nThe palmate newt occurs in Western Europe, from Great Britain (up to Scotland) to northern Portugal and Spain. In the east, it ranges to the Elbe river in Germany and the Czech Republic and the lower and mid Alps in Switzerland. It is most common from 500–1,500 m (1,600–4,900 ft) elevation, but can be found from sea level up to 2,500 m (8,200 ft) (in the Pyrenees).: 224  Genetic analyses by Recuero and García-París suggest that the species was confined to the Iberian Peninsula during the Last Glacial Maximum and then expanded its range north of the Pyrenees.\n\nThey have recently been discovered in South Western Ireland, though it is unclear yet whether they are native or an introduced species.\n\nCommon over most of its range, the palmate newt is found in a variety of habitats, including forest, marshes and pasture.: 224–225  It is less abundant in cultivated areas, but can adapt to gardens. For reproduction, the newts accept different types of stagnant water bodies, preferably fish-free; acidic ponds are well tolerated.: 224–225  The smooth newt occurs over much of the same area, but in France appears to prefer ponds in open land, while the palmate newt prefers forest ponds; hybrids between the two species are rare.\n\nThe reproductive period usually extends from February to May, but can start earlier or last longer in the southern range on the Iberian Peninsula, depending on elevation. The newts can use magnetoreception over larger distances and the calls of frogs over shorter distances to find their breeding ponds. Once in the water, they are active during day and night. Breeding involves a ritualised courtship display as in other closely related newts: The male attempts to attract a female by swimming in front of her and sniffing her cloaca. He then vibrates his tail against his body, sometimes lashing it (but less violently than in the smooth newt), thereby fanning pheromones towards her. In the final phase, its a packet of sperm (a spermatophore). He then guides her over the spermatophore so she picks it up with her cloaca.: 225\n\nThe females lays 150–440 eggs individually on water plants. These are 1.3–1.8 mm in diameter (2.2–3 mm with capsule) and very similar to those of the smooth newt. Larvae hatch after 8–21 days, depending on temperature, at a size of 8–14 mm. The young larvae are yellow–brown, with two black stripes, and have two appendages (balancers) on the sides of the head, which are later resorbed. The colour then becomes more cryptic, and the larvae grow to 3–4 cm (1.2–1.6 in). As they grow, their characteristics are affected by their environment. Specifically, in response to chemical cues from predatory dragonfly larvae, larval newts develop larger heads and tails, and develop darker tail pigmentation. Additionally, dragonflies were more likely to prey on newts without such changes, which may be because a larger tail size facilitates newt predator escape behavior. They metamorphose into land-dwelling juveniles (efts) after 1.5–3.5 months, but some larvae instead overwinter in water. Paedomorphism, where adults keep their gills and stay aquatic, is also known.: 224–225\n\nThe young efts live on land until maturity, which is reached in the second or third year. Activity on land occurs mainly during humid nights. The palmate newt usually hibernates on land but sometimes in the water, and in the Iberian peninsula, it is often active year-round. Larvae, efts and adults mainly feed on various invertebrates, but cannibalism also occurs, mainly by larvae preying on eggs. An age of up to 12 years can be reached in the wild.: 224–225\n\nPalmate newt populations are not in decline overall, and the species has been assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN. In France, it is the most common newt species, but it is rare in Belgium and the Netherlands,: 225  and populations are fragmented on the Iberian peninsula. It is included in some national and regional red lists. Drainage and pollution of breeding sites, the introduction of fish and crayfish, as well as desertification (in the southern range), have been cited as threats. Like all amphibians, it is listed as protected species in the Berne Convention (Appendix III), and it is legally protected by law in the countries it occurs in.",

The males are winged, with brown elytra, a clearer pronotum and a large brown spot in the middle, while females are larviform, wings are missing and they are often twice the size of the males (up to 25 millimetres or 1 inch in length).\n\nThese beetles use their bioluminescence to attract mates. The adult females are mostly famed for their glow, although all stages of their life cycle are capable of glowing.\n\nIn Britain, this species is fairly common compared to its cousin Phosphaenus hemipterus – the lesser glow worm – which is very rare.[citation needed]\n\nThe Lampyris noctiluca, commonly referred to as a glow worm, belongs to the Lampyridae family, which is Greek for \"shining ones,\" and includes species known as fireflies or lightning bugs. Contrary to its name, it is not worm-like, but a beetle. These beetles are typically the most active at night and spend their day under debris, or in the ground. The larvae are also nocturnal and rarely seen — only coming out when the conditions are right in the months of April through October. The adult stage is much shorter than the larvae stage but they are much easier to spot then as they glow for a few hours and only stop glowing after mating.",

      "sections":"The range of this beetle stretches from Portugal and Ireland [citation needed] in the west, right across Europe, Africa and Asia to China in the east. It also survives further north than any other firefly, almost reaching the Arctic Circle. It is not found in North America, South America, South Asia, Australia and Antarctica.\n\nThe Lampris noctiluca has been found mainly in valleys in Wales and Scotland with other appearance in Europe, such as Estonia, Belgium and Finland. They typically favor chalky and limestone areas, open grass, hedges, and woodland and will rarely be found on land which has been improved for agricultural purposes. They prefer open air, especially for evolutionary purposes for the female to be able to attract a male through her light display during the months of June, July, and August.\n\nThe Lampyris noctiluca adult females range in size from 12-20 mm while males are significantly smaller. Larvae are only a few millimeters in length (1). They also have segmented bodies such that females may emit a bioluminescent glow (2). The species exhibits a coloration from brownish to blackish. Males are equipped with two pairs of wings, using the second pair for flying and the first pair, known as elytra, to cover the second. Females, however, do not fly. The insects are characterized by their soft-bodied and elongated form, with a head concealed by a pronotum and threadlike antennae. Luminosity is confined to the last few abdominal segments. Among them, the adult female is notably the most luminous, using her glowing ability to attract males, while larvae also glow but more faintly and only intermittently. The light produces is cold light which benefits the species as they waste little heat. The transform only about 3 percent of their electrical energy into light which is relatively efficient compared to other glowing species. Despite the larvae's similarity to adults in having segmented bodies and six legs near the head, their mode of movement can make them resemble caterpillars.(1).\n\nFor Lampyris noctiluca, or glow worms, producing light is crucial to their mating success, involving an intricate process. These creatures emit a yellowish-green luminescence from the translucent skin on the underside of their last three abdominal segments to lure in the smaller, winged males. They shine for about two hours each night, either retreating to safety after this period or ceasing their glow upon finding a mate, managing to do so for up to 10 consecutive nights. Males can spot this light from as far as 45 meters away. The light is steady, but the females enhance its allure by rhythmically moving their abdomens, creating a pulsing effect of brightening and dimming. While larvae also have the ability to glow, they can more readily switch off their light, particularly if they sense danger. The glow is also observed in pupae when they are disturbed.\n\nGlow worms control their luminescence by regulating the oxygen flow to the light-producing membranes that contain luciferin. This light results from a chemical reaction facilitated by the enzyme luciferase, with its specific structure influenced by the worm's genetic makeup, leading to minor variations in the light among individuals (3). Specifically, the chemistry behind the beetle’s luminescence is the outcome of a chemical reaction involving three essential components: a small organic molecule known as luciferin, named after the bringer of light, the fallen archangel Lucifer; adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a crucial molecule that fuels the synthesis of proteins; and luciferase, the catalyst that drives this illuminating process.(1). Remarkably, this bioluminescent process is highly efficient, converting nearly all its energy output into light with only about 2% lost as heat. The intensity of a female's glow serves as a signal to males, indicating her reproductive potential. Males are drawn to brighter females, which typically indicate a larger size and a higher egg count, prompting a competitive dynamic among females for mating opportunities. Interestingly, artificial lights can also attract males, diverting them from their natural mating pursuits. The peak activity for their glowing display occurs during the evenings of June and July, marking the most vibrant time in their reproductive calendar (3).\n\nLight production is vital for Lampyris noctiluca. With it they have greater chances of mating, so there is a complex process involved.\n\nThey emit yellowish-green light from the translucent underside of their last three abdominal segments to attract the smaller males, which are winged. They will glow for two hours and then retreat back into their hiding place until the next night, or stop glowing as soon as they find a mate. The females can survive for at least 10 consecutive nights doing this.\n\nThe light can be seen by males up to 45 metres away. The light is emitted continuously, although they will wave their abdomens from side to side, which gives the impression of it brightening and dimming. Larvae are sometimes seen to glow, although they seem able to turn off their light more easily than the female, especially when disturbed. The pupae glow when disturbed.\n\nThe insect can regulate its light production by controlling the oxygen supply to the light emitting membranes containing luciferin. The chemical reaction producing the light from luciferin is catalysed by luciferase, the exact chemical structure of which is determined by the glow worms' individual genetic structure, which in turn determines subtle differences in the light produced from individual to individual. Virtually all of the energy produced is light; only 2% is heat.\n\nThe brightness of the glow is used by the males as an indicator of female fecundity. Males are more likely to fly to a brighter female, because it is larger and has more eggs. Due to this, females compete against each other for matings.\n\nThe males are sometimes attracted to man-made light fixtures.\n\nThe peak glowing period is evenings in June and July.\n\nIn the reproduction process of Lampyris noctiluca, the female plays a crucial role in attracting mates. To catch the attention of male glow worms, which fly about a meter off the ground, a female climbs a plant stalk. By positioning herself above most ground-level vegetation and bending her abdomen upwards, she showcases her glowing organs, signaling to any males passing by. This display is part of her adult life, which spans only a few weeks dedicated to glowing, mating, and laying eggs before her death. The eggs hatch into larvae after a few weeks, undergoing a larval stage that lasts for one or two summers, during which they feed on small snails by paralyzing them before consumption. This lengthy development cycle contributes to the observed \"boom or bust\" population cycles of the species, with abundance fluctuating significantly from one year to the next.\n\nUnique to Lampyris noctiluca is its method of sex determination, which is influenced by hormones, a rarity among insects. Sexual differentiation between males and females begins during the fourth larval instar, with distinctions being initially subtle. Male cells in the apical tissue of the gonads start to divide at this stage, contrasting with female cells, which divide in the basal tissue. Remarkably, transplanting testes into females before the fifth instar leads to masculinization, whereas similar procedures performed later or attempts to feminize males do not result in sex reversal. This demonstrates that while testes can transform pre-fifth instar female gonads into male ones, ovaries do not have a feminizing effect on males, highlighting a unique aspect of the species' biology.(2).\n\nOnce the females have attracted the males with their glow, they mate, lay eggs, and die.\n\nTypically, 50–100 are laid over three days, with the adult not surviving to see them hatch.  They are laid in fairly moist places, e.g. stems of grass, under moss and under leaf litter.\n\nThe eggs are pale yellow, 1 mm across. They may glow faintly yellow.\n\nThe eggs hatch after two or three weeks, possibly longer in colder climates.  Larvae and adult females look similar, but larvae have bright spots on each of 12 segments, whereas adult females have a completely black back.\n\nThe predatory larvae feed for two or three years on slugs and snails which they inject with a brown, toxic, digestive fluid, delivered by a series of nips and bites. The poison takes time to work, and the larva must to be careful not to become stuck to any protective mucus that its prey may secrete. The prey is gradually paralysed and the digestive fluid turns part of it into a brown broth that the larva can lap up. The prey remains alive, and some partially eaten victims have been known to crawl away after the meal.\n\nThe slugs and snails are often 200 times the weight of the beetle larva. The larvae are nocturnal, and are most active during moist conditions, when their prey are most active.\n\nThe larvae may moult four to five times in their lifetimes. They spend winters under logs, stones, wood holes, or leaf litter, their bodies drawn in like concertinas, hibernating as food becomes increasingly difficult to find. They awaken in spring, and the cycle is repeated for one more year, or possibly two.\n\nThey become adults from May to July or sometimes later, surviving on food reserves accumulated during time as a larva, and dying after reproducing.\n\nThey undergo their entire feeding phase during the larval stage, The larvae are fierce predators and roam leaf litter in search of slugs and snails. (1). They do this by injecting their prey with digestive enzymes and then consuming the liquefied internal contents. In stark contrast, the adult glow worms lack mouthparts entirely, rendering them unable to eat.(2).\n\nThese beetles rely heavily on light for their reproductive processes. However, the rise of artificial lighting, even in rural settings, poses a significant challenge. Such light sources can complicate the males' search for partners. A 2014 study highlighted that minimal levels of light pollution can disrupt the mating behaviors of male L. noctiluca, as they struggle to find females. This research underscores the potential link between declining glow-worm populations and light pollution, suggesting that it warrants consideration as a contributing factor.(5).\n\nThey are found in old-growth grassland, especially on chalk and limestone soils. They are also found in verges, hedgebanks, and on heaths. The larvae live in sheltered places – under rocks and wood, but do crawl over different terrains.\n\nThreats include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, pesticide use, pollution, distraction by artificial lights, insufficient grazing and climate change.",

Throughout much of the squirrel's range, especially in Utah, the population density fluctuates greatly, with periods of high density followed by periods of low density. Average population density also varies by season, with higher density in autumn relative to late spring.\n\nThe white-tailed antelope squirrel is commonly spotted in arid habitats throughout the southwestern United States. Throughout this range, Ammospermophilus leucurus is omnivorous, feeding primarily on foliage (10%-60% of its diet), seeds (20%-50%), arthropods, and to a lesser extent, vertebrates (mainly lizards and rodents; predatory behavior by ground squirrels has been noted).  In conjunction with being a predator, the white-tailed antelope squirrel is also prey to many larger animals, including raptors, various canids, and snakes. These squirrels are not only preyed upon by large predators, but they also fall victim to many diverse ectoparasites. These include various ticks, fleas, mites, lice, and a couple species of parasitic larvae.\n\nAntelope squirrels are active most during the cooler parts of the daylight hours, avoiding midday as much as possible. Although these animals live in hot and arid climates, the white-tailed antelope squirrel is diurnal, meaning heat gain from metabolic activity could be a problem. However, compared to direct exposure of heat from the sun, metabolic heat gain contributes little to the overheating of this species. This diurnal activity pattern may be attributed to predation patterns. Selective pressures may have led to this species avoiding nighttime activity due to increased predation by nighttime predators. This behavior is controlled by the squirrels' natural circadian rhythms, and research has shown these rhythms to be highly important in keeping these diurnal activity patterns intact.\n\nWhite-tailed antelope squirrels' reproductive receptiveness in females and reproductive capability in males peaks in early spring. It only takes the squirrels one year to become sexually mature and begin reproducing; typically, antelope ground squirrels will produce one large litter per year.\n\nGeographical factors, and thus environmental factors, weigh heavily on Ammospermophilus leucurus' reproductive cycle length and average litter size. Specifically, this variation is seen best when comparing the northern and southern extents of the antelope ground squirrels' distribution. In Oregon, which is the northernmost extent of the squirrels' range, reproductive cycles are relatively short, and the average litter size is 9.3. However, in Baja California, the southernmost extent of the squirrels' range, reproductive cycles last half of the year, and the average litter size is 5.9.",

It is found in Asia, Africa, Australia, Costa Rica, Hispaniola, Colombia, and Southern Europe and in 2000, it was discovered in Florida. C. citricola differs from many of its close relatives due its ability to live in a wide variety of environments. In North America and South America, the spider has caused extensive damage to agricultural operations.\n\nC. citricola is in the orb web spider family, but its orb webs are considered atypical. They have a thick silk strand barrier above the orb and a thinner barrier below the orb. This gives the webs a horizontal mesh-like appearance. The spider has developed distinct and specific prey-capturing techniques using its unconventional webs. The prey flies into the upper mesh layer of the web and is deflected into the orb web. The spider then collects and stores the prey in its web. The difference in C. citricola's web silk stems from physiological variations in its spinning apparatuses, as compared to other closely related species. Its webs are non-adhesive and do not require daily respinning.\n\nThis spider is one of the few species to exhibit a variable level of sociality. C. citricola can be seen in colonies, which may have arisen due to reduced predation. Within these colonies, each spider has its own web that is linked to other spiders through communal webbing. The spider webs are often built in large matrices next to one another and can span entire trees. The spider usually peacefully coexists with other spiders in the colony. However, at times the spider may have to ward off other spiders in the colony that may try and claim its web.\n\nC. citricola is nocturnal, only performing necessary tasks during the day. During the day, it remains idle and tries to stay out of sight from predators. Most of its foraging and prey capture happen at night.\n\nC. citricola's color and size can vary greatly. Many spiders sport a black and white pattern while others are brown. Males often appear black. Male and female spiders have a sexual dimorphism.

      "sections":"Peter Forsskal discovered Cyrtophora citricola in the Arabian Peninsula during his Yemen expedition, sometime between 1761 and 1763. He first saw the spiders in citrus trees and described their horizontal webs as nets. The spider's common name, \"tropical tent-web\", derives from these observations. Upon Forsskal's death of malaria in 1763, his manuscripts, which included details of the spider, were collected and sent from Yemen back to Denmark by his friend Carsten Niebuhr. These records were published in 1775 as Descriptiones animalium, avium, amphibiorum, piscium, insectorum, vermium; the spider appeared under the name Aranea citricola. C. citricola was classified in the Araneidae family because it creates orb-webs. Between 1776 and 1864, the spider was classified under the genus Epeira, a synonym for Aranea, more commonly known as Araneus. The spider was moved from the genus Aranea to the genus Cyrtophora by Eugene Simon in 1864 – a decision made because its webs were so different from those constructed by other spiders in the genus Aranea. C. citricola webs are horizontal and tent-shaped, similar to those of other spiders in the genus Cyrtophora. Like other members of Cyrtophora, C. citricola's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pairs of legs have a shorter combined patella and tibia length than the femurs on the same legs. Additionally, it shares the same eye pattern where the posterior eye row is recurved: a typical genus-defining trait. C. citricola has broader cephalic structures than other orb-web spiders in the genus Manogea.\n\nCyrtophora citricola falls into the family Araneidae because of three characteristics. The male's palpal faces the mesial, or midline of the body. The male spider's palpal has an exoskeleton on their bulbous known as a radix, and the spider has a thin reflective layer of tissue in the posterior set of its eyes called the tapetum. C. citricola differs from \"derived araneoids\", which are a part of the superfamily Araneoidea, such as Theridion and Linyphiidae, because it lacks smaller aciniform spigots in their median spinnerets. These spigots each individually produce a strand of aciniform silk, the strongest type of spider silk. C. citricola is a part of the argiopoid clade because there is a sexual dimorphism between males and females. Female are larger than males. The sexual dimorphism present in C. citricola separates them from members of the Araneinae subfamily including Nuctenea, Cyclosa, and Mangora. C. citricola is a part of the Cyrtophorinae subfamily and shares the sexual dimorphism trait with the Argiopinae, Gasteracanthinae, and Micratheninae subfamilies. Within the argiopoid clade, C. citricola is a member of the argiopine clade because the upper section of its exoskeleton is hairy. This trait distinguishes C. citricola from the Gasteracanthinae and Micratheninae subfamilies. Within the argiopine clade, C. citricola is a member of the Cyrtophorinae family, which includes the genera Cyrtophora and Manogea. Cyrtophorinae's subfamily defining features are its embolus, the palpal bulb's open duct, running in a counterclockwise direction, and its non-adhesive orb-webs.\n\nCyrtophora citricola occurs in various colors and may have different colored spots on the abdomen. The spider is sexually dimorphic. Females may reach 10 millimetres (0.39 in) long and are larger than their male counterparts who are usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) long. C. citricola's legs are different lengths with legs I and II being the longest. In Florida, male spiders are black, while females can change the color of their abdomens to match their surroundings and can camouflage in their webs. The females have white trichobothria. In Turkey, they usually appear brown with grey hair. C. citricola has a distinctive horizontal bifurcation at the posterior abdomen. C. citricola is different from its other relatives because it has two pairs of dorsal tubercles and a pair of posterior tubercles. C. citricola typically has seven denticles. The opisthosoma has two dorsal pairs of protuberances and two posterior lobes. C. citricola has two rows of eyes. The largest eyes are the two median eyes in the anterior row. In some places, C. citricola may be confused with Mecynogea lemniscata.\n\nCyrtophora citricola is found in Asia, Africa, Australia, Costa Rica, Hispaniola, Colombia, and Southern Europe. The species is unable to survive in temperatures below -1 °C (30.2 °F). C. citricola was also discovered in Florida in 2000 and it makes its webs on canal bridges from the east end of Everglades National Park to the east coast. The spider lives in a wide range of environments, but it is most prevalent in olive orchards and undergrowth. C. citricola is also found in tropical agricultural operations.\n\nC. citricola can be found globally, unlike its close relatives that are concentrated in specific parts of the world. C. citricola's global presence may be a problem as seen in the Americas. The spider is becoming common in agricultural and urban spaces. It is damaging farm operations. Currently, there are active efforts to remove the spider as its web is known to damage flora.\n\nC. citricola exhibits thermoregulative behaviors. This trait is common in web-building spiders, including Nephila clavipes, N. maculata, and Frontinella communis. During the hottest portions of the day, the spider will position themselves so that as little surface area of their body is shown to the sun as possible.\n\nCyrtophora citricola builds tent-webs that have a horizontal orb web and a network of webs above it resembling a tent. These webs can be built alone or as part of a colony. The spiders exhibit advantages living in colonies, but there is no selection towards either solitary or colonial living. Within colonies, the horizontal orb webs are solitary and maintained by individuals. Other Araneidae species have a triad complex on their posterior spinnerets which produce a gluey thread material for the webs from the piriform glands. C. citricola lacks a triad complex and is unable to make gluey thread web material so it creates a distinct non-sticky, mesh-like web.\n\nC. citricola creates a thick silk strand barrier above the orb and a thinner barrier below the orb. The silk above the web is used to deflect insects onto the orb web below. The webs above and below the horizontal orb webs are communal and maintained by the colony. The horizontal orb web and silk are not sticky.  The orb webs appear as a fine mesh curtaining, made of radii and a non-adhesive structural spiral. This structure is different than the typical Araneidae family webs, as they lack a viscid spiral. These webs are durable, and may have evolved to be created outside of citrus trees. The webs may be large enough to span entire trees and are found on a variety of tree species. C. citricola prefers to build its webs on firm substrates rather than non-firm substrates. Webs built on firmer substrates tend to last for longer periods of time. The webs are strong enough to withstand environmental pressures, such as rain and wind. Unlike adhesive webs, which must be respun daily, non-adhesive webs are only repaired when damaged. Most of this damage occurs at the peripheries of colony webs where the costs to create orb-webs is high. The center of these colonies infrequently require repairs, saving the spider the constant investment of respinning the web.\n\nC. citricola typically rests with all of its legs underneath its body when it is not watching over its egg sacs and uses various motions to detect prey and intrusions. The spider sits on the hub of the web. This positioning occurs during the night and day. C. citricola also participates in web jerking, an act of quickly pulling the radii with a front leg. Web jerking may occur in response to movement in the web and prey capturing. The behavior may allow the spider to accurately find objects in its web, assist in prey location, and transmit signals. In addition, the spider engages in web shaking, motions that cause sudden and rapid shaking of its webs. This shaking is created by a downward motion from the spiders' legs. C. citricola engages in web shaking to dislodge prey stuck in the upper barrier of the web. It may also shake off approaching kleptoparasites.\n\nC. citricola captures its prey in the upper section of the web. The rate of prey per capita due to web deflection is relatively low and may cause spiders to aggregate together. Spiders who live in social aggregates are more efficient at capturing prey than solitary spiders.\n\nThe process of capturing prey includes multiple steps. The first step is either biting the prey or wrapping it in silk. The second step is pulling and cutting the prey out of the web. The third step involves transporting the prey to the hub of the web by either carrying it in its jaws or rewrapping it and carrying it in silk. In the fourth step, the spider feeds on the prey in the hub of the web.\n\nC. citricola has four attack sequences. In the first variation, the spider wraps its prey and bites it. After biting the prey, the spider removes the prey from the web, rewraps it, and transports it to the hub. The second sequence follows the steps of the first variation but skips the biting stage. The third variation starts with the spider biting its prey and wrapping its prey. Later, the prey is removed and rewrapped before being transported to the web hub. The fourth sequence involves spiders biting and pulling or cutting the prey. The prey is transported to the hub in the spider's jaws. Whether the prey is bitten, wrapped, or both is determined by the type of prey that is captured.\n\nC. citricola preys on moths and flies. These insects are bitten and carried to the hub on silk. Orthopteras are also captured and eaten by C. citricola using a variety of the above sequences. Other common prey include dragonflies, beetles, and pentatomids.\n\nC. citricola is active from the middle of summer to the beginning of fall and adults mate between June and September. Adult male spiders look for females. These spiders exhibit sexual cannibalism at high rates. Female spiders will often eat males after mating. Females cannibalize males after most successful copulations, up to 100% of the time. Spider age and feeding state have no effect on whether the male will be cannibalized. This sexual cannibalism encourages males to be choosy when picking a female mate. Males prefer to mate younger, well-fed, and virgin females. Females are not as choosy in their male mates, but may prefer well-fed and older males. About 50% of females re-mate within ten days after their first copulation. Sexual cannibalism forces monogamy on the male spiders.\n\nThe female begins the mating process. Females traditionally approach the male until they are 1 cm from the male. At this point, the male advances quickly towards the female and tries to insert his pedipalp. If successful, copulation begins and lasts for a few seconds. This is the stage at which copulation most often fails.\n\nUnlike other cannibalizing spiders, the male C. citricola does not somersault into the female's chelicerae. The female bends her cephalothorax and orients herself to attack the male's abdomen while the pedipalp is in the female. The male is eaten and the pedipalp is detached from the female.\n\nC. citricola may exhibit aggregate social interactions with one another and live cooperatively in groups. This behavior is distinct amongst spiders, as most spiders are solitary. C. citricola make their own individual webs, but these webs are interconnected. This large network of webs with neighboring spiders creates a massive web matrix. Given the large size and visibility of the colonial web, prey who are visually acute may avoid approaching the colony. If one member of a colonial group senses a nearby predator or prey, they perform a knee jerk on the web. This jerk often begins a chain reaction; up to 75% of nearby spiders may follow suit and jerk their webs as well. Within colonies, there are three zones where spiders may live: the outside, the intermediate, and the inside zones. Spiders living in the intermediate zone have the best rates of prey capture. Larger colonies have higher prey capture rates compared to smaller colonies and capture rates are higher for spiders at night compared to day.\n\nC. citricola generally coexist peacefully. They may exhibit aggressive behaviors if another spider tries to take their prey. Colony living may have evolved because of the foraging benefits of group living for the spiders, although solitary living may be favored when prey is scarce. Conditional sociality is another evolutionary explanation for why group living evolved in this species. Possibilities for this development may be protection against parasites or predators and how colonial webs allow juveniles to easily create their first webs.\n\nSome C. citricola live individually with no colony, alone without other organisms.  Solitary spiders have larger webs, produce more eggs, and have more kleptoparasites than colonies. There is no difference in female size and prey capture rates when comparing colonial and solitary spiders. There are two hypotheses for the limited physical differences between solitary and colonial spiders. The first hypothesis is that spiders can move back and forth between colonial and solitary living throughout their lives. The second hypothesis is that prey capture is similar in both colonial and solitary spiders, allowing for similar physical development. Both hypotheses may explain the many similarities between solitary and colonial spiders.\n\nC. citricola exhibits territorial behavior over its orb-webs, but tent webs are communal and no aggressive behavior was documented between spiders that travel across these webs. At night there are conflicts between orb-less spiders and orb-possessing spiders. These fights occur due to competition for better feeding locations. Larger spiders typically win in fights over smaller spiders. Invading spiders may come from the colony's periphery, where costs to build webs are often high due to continuous repair and diminished prey capture. Peripheral webs often experience damage from weather and predators whereas central webs remain undisturbed. Conflict arises when an orb-less intruder approaches and vibrates the web. This action is a sign of attack and solicits the same response from the defending spider. The vibrations between the attacker and the defender continue for a few minutes; however, the invader rarely captures the web and instead it retreats.\n\nThe egg sacs of C. citricola have a diameter ranging from 12–20 millimetres (0.47–0.79 in). These egg sacs are laid in chains of up to 10 sacs in a row on the webs. The eggs are colored bluish-green. Each egg sac contains between 100 and 200 eggs and the eggs are shaped as flat ellipticals. The number of eggs produced depends on various environmental factors, including food availability. Solitary females can produce up to 20% more eggs than females living in colonies. The reduction of eggs in colonies may be due to better parasite protection and reduced predation. Females with egg sacs will typically rest directly underneath the egg sac in order to guard them.\n\nJuveniles usually disperse or build their own webs off the maternal webs after four days. Juveniles in larger webs are less likely to leave their mother's web. Mothers feed offspring, but when prey is scarce there is increased sibling aggression. These resource-poor conditions increase the likelihood of early dispersal from the maternal web.\n\nC. citricola prefers to select nest sites and create webs in the forks between branches and leaves.\n\nArgyrodes argyrodes, another species of spider, may steal Cyrtophora citricola's prey and eggs. In addition, Holocnemus pluchei, also known as daddy long-legs, has been found to build their webs off of C. citricola's webs. H. pluchei exhibit aggressive behavior towards C. citricola and are observed eating C. citricola juveniles. C. citricola will drop to the ground if attacked, in an attempt to camouflage. C. citricola may also pull all of its legs inwards towards its abdomen.\n\nA. gibbosus often acts as a kleptoparasite to C. citricola, stealing prey that the C. citricola caught. A. gibbosus is known to switch strategies depending on where the host is located. Prey is stolen when the host is in the hub of the web. A. gibbosus has been observed waiting for C. citricola to go foraging before consuming their eggs.\n\nPediobius pyrgo is a type of wasp that lays its eggs in C. citricola egg sacs. The wasp is present in the Iberian Peninsula and in the Canary Islands. Philolema palanichamyi is another type of wasp that lays its eggs in C. citricola egg sacs. The wasp affects these spiders primarily in the Canary Islands and can parasitize around 40% of egg sacs. Wasp larvae feed on the spider's eggs and each larva will devour significant portions of the egg sacs; incubation lasts approximately seven weeks. Wasp larvae often cause a large portion of parasitized spider egg-sacs to die. Parasitization decreases emerging spiderling populations by approximately 60%.\n\nCyrtophora citricola can change its abdomen's color to blend in with the environment. The coloring of the female Floridian spiders allows them to appear as brown, dead leaves when sitting in their webs, preventing potential predators from spotting them.\n\nOrnamental trees, fruit trees, and various flowering plants in the genus Eugenia including E. coronata, have high concentrations of Cyrtophora citricola. These plants and trees may experience incomplete death when C. citricola's webs span over their leaves. This may be due to the thickness of the webs that can restrict airflow to the leaves. As a result, some authorities have opted to use high-pressure water sprayers and chemical controls to exterminate colonies.\n\nC. citricola is problematic for many agricultural operations in South America, including coffee and citrus plantations. It is listed as an important agricultural pest in the Dominican Republic due to its devastating impact on citrus trees. Additionally, it is increasingly common in the Southern states of North America. In Florida, the spider has become a common backyard nuisance.",

      "introduction":"\n\nDung beetles are beetles that feed on feces. Some species of dung beetles can bury dung 250 times their own mass in one night.\n\nMany dung beetles, known as rollers, roll dung into round balls, which are used as a food source or breeding chambers. Other dung beetles like Euoniticellus intermedius, known as tunnelers, bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the dwellers, neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in dung. They are often attracted by the feces collected by burrowing owls. There are dung beetle species of various colors and sizes, and some functional traits such as body mass (or biomass) and leg length can have high levels of variability.\n\nAll the species belong to the superfamily Scarabaeoidea, most of them to the subfamilies Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae of the family Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles). As most species of Scarabaeinae feed exclusively on feces, that subfamily is often dubbed true dung beetles. There are dung-feeding beetles which belong to other families, such as the Geotrupidae (the earth-boring dung beetle). The Scarabaeinae alone comprises more than 5,000 species.\n\nThe nocturnal African dung beetle Scarabaeus satyrus is one of the few known invertebrate animals that navigate and orient themselves using the Milky Way. The daily dung of one elephant can support 2,000,000 beetles.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Dung beetles are not a single taxonomic group; dung feeding is found in a number of families of beetles, so the behaviour cannot be assumed to have evolved only once.\n\nDung beetles live in many habitats, including desert, grasslands and savannas, farmlands, and native and planted forests. They are highly influenced by the environmental context, and do not prefer extremely cold or dry weather. They are found on all continents except Antarctica. They eat the dung of herbivores and omnivores, and prefer that produced by the latter. Many of them also feed on mushrooms and decaying leaves and fruits. The Neotropical Deltochilum valgum, D. kolbei and D. viridescens are carnivores with a strong preference for preying upon millipedes. Two other species from Brazil, Canthon dives and Canthon virens, prey on queens and other winged forms of leafcutter ants. One species from the Iberian Peninsula, Thorectes lusitanicus, feeds on acorns. Dung beetles do not necessarily have to eat or drink anything else, because the dung provides all the necessary nutrients.[citation needed]\n\nMost dung beetles search for dung using their sensitive sense of smell. Some smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung-providers to wait for the dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 10 times their weight. Male Onthophagus taurus beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people.\n\nA species of dung beetle (the African Scarabaeus zambesianus) navigates by polarization patterns in moonlight,  the first animal known to do so. Dung beetles can also navigate when only the Milky Way or clusters of bright stars are visible,  making them the only insects known to orient themselves by the Milky Way. Research using 1 kg bolus of elephant dung found that a larger number exploit it during the night (13,700) than during the day (3,330).  The eyes of dung beetles are superposition compound eyes typical of many scarabaeid beetles;\nThe sequence of images shows a sequence of the beetle rolling a dung ball. It does this to navigate.\n\nCambefort and Hanski (1991) classified dung beetles into three functional types based on their feeding and nesting strategies such as – Rollers, Tunnelers and Dwellers. The \"rollers\" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the ball, then mate underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of mass provisioning.\n\nSome species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete metamorphosis. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.\n\nThe behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of Jean Henri Fabre in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.\n\nThey are widely used in ecological research as a good bioindicator group to examine the impacts of climate disturbances, such as extreme droughts and associated fires, and human activities on tropical biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, such as seed dispersal, soil bioturbation and nutrient cycling.\n\nDung beetles play a role in agriculture and tropical forests. By burying and consuming dung, they improve nutrient recycling and soil structure. Dung beetles have been further shown to improve soil conditions and plant growth on rehabilitated coal mines in South Africa. They are also important for the dispersal of seeds present in animals' dung, influencing seed burial and seedling recruitment in tropical forests. They can protect livestock, such as cattle, by removing the dung which, if left, could provide habitat for pests such as flies. Therefore, many countries have introduced the creatures for the benefit of animal husbandry. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.\n\nIn Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) commissioned the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985) which, led by George Bornemissza, sought to introduce species of dung beetles from South Africa and Europe. The successful introduction of 23 species was made, most notably Digitonthophagus gazella and Euoniticellus intermedius, which has resulted in improvement of the quality and fertility of Australian cattle pastures, along with a reduction in the population of pestilent Australian bush flies by around 90%. In 1995 it was reported that dung beetles were being trialled in the Sydney beach suburb of Curl Curl to deal with dog droppings.\n\nAn application has been made by Landcare Research to import up to 11 species of dung beetle into New Zealand. As well as improving pasture soils the Dung Beetle Release Strategy Group say that it would result in a reduction in emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas) from agriculture. There is, however, strong opposition from some at the University of Auckland, and a few others, based on the risks of the dung beetles acting as vectors of disease. There are public health researchers at the University of Auckland who agree with the current EPA risk assessment and there are several Landcare programmes in Australia that involve schoolchildren collecting dung beetles.\n\nThe African dung beetle (D. gazella) was introduced in several locations in North and South America and has been spreading its distribution to other regions by natural dispersal and accidental transportation, and is now probably naturalized in most countries between México and Argentina. The exotic species might be useful for controlling diseases of livestock in commercial areas, and might displace native species in modified landscapes; however, data is not conclusive about its effect on native species in natural environments and further monitoring is required.\n\nLike many other insects, (dried) dung beetle, called qiāngláng (蜣蜋) in Chinese, is used in Chinese herbal medicine. It is recorded in the \"Insect section\" (蟲部) of the Compendium of Materia Medica, where it is recommended for the cure of 10 diseases.[citation needed]\n\nIn Isan, Northeastern Thailand, the local people eat many different kinds of insects, including the dung beetle. There is an Isan song กุดจี่หายไปใหน \"Where Did the Dung Beetle Go\", which relates the replacement of water buffalo with the \"metal\" buffalo, which does not provide the dung needed for the dung beetle and has led to the increasing rarity of the dung beetle in the agricultural region.[citation needed]\n\nThe Mediterranean dung beetle (Bubas bison) has been used in conjunction with biochar stock fodder to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, which are both greenhouse gases. The beetles work the biochar-enriched dung into the soil without the use of machines.\n\nScientists in Canberra in 1965 discovered that Dung beetles (Scarabaeids), specifically Onthophagus australis Guérin-Méneville, improve plant yields using their dung. Japanese millet was studied and data on nutrient uptake. These plants were placed in pots lacking nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Cow-dung was then added in treatment groups with or without O. australis. Some treatment groups even had two out of the three nutrients supplemented in the pots. Comparisons of the treatment and control groups were made to show that top growth and roots significantly increased when the dung was mixed well into the soil in the pots. Results showed that dung beetle activity greatly improved plant life. The dung has little impact alone, but in combination with the dung beetle, the nutritional value for the plants increases greatly. This suggests that dung beetles have many positive implications for the environment, including a beneficial role with plant life.\n\nSome dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used therapeutically (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.\n\nSeveral species of the dung beetle, most notably the species Scarabaeus sacer (often referred to as the sacred scarab), enjoyed a sacred status among the ancient Egyptians.\n\nEgyptian hieroglyphic script uses the image of the beetle to represent a triliteral phonetic that Egyptologists transliterate as xpr or ḫpr and translate as \"to come into being\", \"to become\" or \"to transform\". The derivative term xprw or ḫpr(w) is variously translated as \"form\", \"transformation\", \"happening\", \"mode of being\" or \"what has come into being\", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.\nThe scarab was linked to Khepri (\"he who has come into being\"), the god of the rising sun. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male-sexed, and reproduced by depositing semen into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. Plutarch wrote:\n\nThe race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some New Kingdom royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of Ramses VI portrays the nightly \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of the sun as being swallowed by Nut, goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.\n\nThe image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and funerary art.\n\nExcavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, ivory, stone, Egyptian faience, and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or cartouche. Some have been used as seals. Pharaohs sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the commemorative scarab of Queen Tiye. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at Luxor Temple, at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see Serapis) and elsewhere in Egypt.\n\nThe scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such \"heart scarabs\" is the yellow-green pectoral scarab found among the entombed provisions of Tutankhamen. It was carved from a large piece of Libyan desert glass. The purpose of the \"heart scarab\" was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the \"transformation spells\" of the Coffin Texts, which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (xpr) into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.\n\nOne scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:\n\nIt may not have gone unnoticed that the pupa, whose wings and legs are encased at this stage of development, is very mummy-like. It has even been pointed out that the egg-bearing ball of dung is created in an underground chamber which is reached by a vertical shaft and horizontal passage curiously reminiscent of Old Kingdom mastaba tombs.\"\n\nIn contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for seals of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean LMLK seals (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of Hezekiah.\n\nThe scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue \"for luck\".\n\nIn Aesop's fable \"The Eagle and the Beetle\", the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle's eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to Olympus and places her latest eggs in Zeus's lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.\n\nAristophanes alluded to Aesop's fable several times in his plays. In Peace, the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.\n\nHans Christian Andersen's \"The Dung Beetle\" tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king's horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king's horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his feeling of superiority to other animals. He finally returns to the stable having decided (against all logic) that it is for him that the king's horse wears golden shoes.\n\nIn Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, the transformed character of Gregor Samsa is called an \"old dung beetle\" (alter Mistkäfer) by a charwoman.",

The largest, most diverse and recently diverged of the four halictid subfamilies, Halictinae (sweat bees) is made up of five tribes of which L. figueresi is part of Halictini, which is made up of over 2000 species. Genus Lasioglossum is informally divided into two series: the Lasioglossum series and the Hemihalictus. L. figueresi belongs to the latter and is part of the subgenus Dialictus which is made up mostly of New World species. It is most closely related to L. marginatum, L. politum,\nand L. aeneiventre.\n\nL. figueresi is closely related morphologically to L. aeneiventre. Unusually large, it is described in relation to L. aeneiventre as well as other Dialictus. In general, L. figueresi differs from other bees by its wings, hair, and markings.\n\nA female L. figueresi is recognized from L. aeneiventre and other Dialictus by its unique striped pattern on the sternum of its mesothorax, the pattern of punctures on its front scutum of its middle thoracic segment, its larger size, its hair, and its slightly yellow wings including the membrane, veins, and stigma. Generally larger than males, it has a metallic dark-green head and a clypeal length greater than that of its supraclypeal area, which is slightly rounded and bulges. It does not have a frontal line ridge from below the base of the antenna to about half the distance between its antennal sockets to its median ocellus, and its lateral ocelli are slightly nearer to each other than to their compound eyes. It has punctures near its eyes, on the lower half of the clypeus, sometimes on the supraclypeal area, and on the frons, while its gena is shiny and its supraclypeal area and frons have dull spaces in between. In the middle of its thorax, it has a groove that is two-thirds the length of its metallic dark-green scutum of its middle thoracic segment, with deep punctures that divide as one moves towards the head, as well as about twelve stripes on each side which almost wrap around the propodeum. Its black metasoma is shiny and mostly smooth, its brown-tinted black legs are shiny and flattened on the front surface with a well-defined rim raised above the surface of the plate at the base of the tarsus, and its sharply rounded wings have dull yellow membranes with smokey tips. Its veins and stigma are a golden-yellow-brown. It has yellowish hair on its head, abundant golden yellow hair on its mesosoma, long, plumose, and golden hair on its metanotum, metasomal terga, and metasoma, slightly yellow, short, and fine hair on its tegula, yellow-white fringed hair on the pseudopygidial area, and a dense golden band of hair on its pronotal lobe.\n\nA male L. figueresi is distinct from other Dialictus by many of the female characteristics as well as those of its genitals. In comparison to a female, its compound eyes on its dark-green head converge more below and become wavy, and it has punctures on the clypeal area, vertex, and frons. Its scutum of its middle thoracic segment has a deeply grooved middle line and a parapsidal line like in the female, its clypeus is dark green-purple with dark brown antennae that are lighter underneath and a brownish black tegula, and its terga has very close punctures with a shiny terga I-IV. Compared to the females, the male's wings are clearer, its veins are nearly brown, and its yellow to golden-yellow hair is sparser. Its genitalia also differs from other Dialictus since its gonostylus is nearly equal in length to its gonocoxite with the additional shape and position of the hairs.\n\nL. figueresi is a tropical bee that nests in the ground of highly disturbed, highly populated, and highly cultivated areas of Costa Rica's Mesenta Central. The nests are made of material that is easily accessible from their location. This region's weather consists of a dry season from late November or December until April or May and a subsequent wet season with a small period of less rain. It is found in groups of nests, similar to the American sweat bee Lasioglossum zephyrus, and these groups are more numerous at higher elevations. Nests are marked by turrets made of small mud balls and are constructed during the night at the active season's beginning. A female adds to the turrets with its pygidium after bringing mud from inside the nest. When turrets are destroyed, it will only repair or replace them if the soil is soft and malleable and will not close off the entrance like some other types of bees.\n\nUsually found close together, the nests of L. figueresi are made up of earthen material with entrances to nests sometimes fused together. Earthen turrets, made up of small balls of mud which form a bumpy exterior and smooth interior, indicate the position of these nests, and the tunnels of these nests are almost perpendicular to the surrounding surface. Cells, coated in shiny secretions, are shortened tunnels that branch off from the main tunnel, and, once used, are normally filled up with dirt and not re-used.\n\nDuring the lull in the wet season, from late June to early July, female L. figueresi emerge from their nests, mate, and then either establish new nests or, more rarely, re-use old nests. Heavy rains prevent much mating and foraging but some females keep extra cells open for new larvae for sporadic favorable weather during the rainy season. Nests typically contain a female and her offspring and are enlarged at the beginning of the dry season in late November and early December. Only seasonally active, females store up pollen only until mid-February and die after their first season of reproduction. During the dry season, it is more difficult to dig up the hardening soil so there is less creation of nests. Broods stay and grow in their nest. By May, males and females co-exist yet don't work on the nest at this time. After about 80 days, which is considerably longer than the 20 to 35 days of other halictine bees, they become young adults and leave the nest around mid-June, mating with others and starting the cycle over again.\n\nIn general, female L. figueresi are mated with developed ovaries. Development, however, starts with the larvae, feeding on pollen and nectar, in the nest. As they grow, males and females live together. When they become adults at around 80 days, they leave the nest, mate with others, and then after preparing the next generation through the creation or re-use of nests, they die.\n\nThe odors of female L. figueresi are an important stimulus for sexual attraction in males. Each female has its own unique scent. In cage experiments, male L. figueresi were more inclined towards dead females that were untreated compared to dead females that were washed in hexane, which removed their odor. The odor of females even increased the response of males to other cues. In the field, males attempted to copulate with models when paired with a female scent. These results also indicate that stimulation by sight increases with the presence of female odors. Female attractiveness is variable, and males take note of each other's preferences in choosing females. Therefore, less attractive females are less likely to mate.\n\nDuring the characteristic lull of the rainy season, male and female L. figueresi leave their nest in order to mate. Males patrol the aggregations in an area, and when they notice a female that lands, they fly in a snake-like path towards her, pouncing on her head and causing them to fall together to the ground. There is no courtship, only copulatory vibrations that occur for various lengths of time. Additionally, males sometimes jump on other males' heads or other wasps or insects. While flying around, males are not overtly aggressive to other males. However they attempt to push off other males who are copulating with females.\n\nAfter continued interaction with one female, a male L. figueresi becomes less and less responsive to that female and therefore less likely to continue mating with her. This habituation shows that males learn from female odors which makes it more likely for them to mate with a greater variety of females. Additionally, males have developed the ability to learn and remember which females are responsive or nonresponsive to them, therefore decreasing the amount of time they waste on females who are nonresponsive. With their increased learning ability, they can also differentiate between receptive females and choose those who are more genetically favorable.\n\nAs solitary bees, L. figueresi interact differently with the environment around them. Sometimes more than one female works on a nest, which affects the size and scope of the nest. Additionally, females have a routine that helps them become more effective at providing for their offspring.\n\nIn general, a nest contains one female L. figueresi and her offspring. In 9% to 21% of the time, two females can be found at a nest. However, there is no strong difference in size between the two females, even in comparing a mated female with an unmated female. Additionally, two-female nests contained either two mated females with developed ovarioles or one mated female with developed ovarioles and one unmated female with undeveloped ones. Having an additional female can double the amount of cells that a nest could contain, compared to other social insects which decline in efficacy as the number of individuals increases. Solitary female nests can contain up to 14 cells while two-female nests can have up to 24 cells. However, the solitary nature of L. figueresi could have evolved away from eusociality. Between two unrelated females, body size was found to not be related to which bee would be more aggressive to the other, yet for bees from a reproductive time period, the female with the larger ovaries was more likely to be aggressive while the one with smaller ovaries was more likely to withdraw. Therefore, these solitary bees could still be affected by qualities of social bees as shown by their appropriate behaviors in response to other females. Additionally, females recognize bees from their own nest and are more aggressive towards those from other nests.\n\nFemale L. figueresi begin their day around 8 or 9 AM when the temperature reaches 20–21 °C (68–70 °F). They sit at the entrance to their nest for up to 14 minutes, most likely warming up their muscles needed for flight, and then forage between 7 and 46 minutes. They can make up to 5 foraging trips a day if the weather is favorable.\n\nL. figueresi, though solitary, interacts with plants and parasites. Plants provide it with pollen and nectar as food for both themselves and their larvae, while parasites invade their nests and affect their survival. As a result, these bees have evolved defenses in response to these parasites.\n\nThe diet of L. figueresi consists of balls of pollen from larvae to adults. Adult females search for and consume pollen balls made from several sources such as Melampodium divaricatum, which is unique to L. figueresi and is most likely due to its abundance in their area, Croton bilbergianus, and other Asteraceae. Additionally, they stock cells with both pollen and nectar for their larvae.\n\nThe main parasite of L. figueresi is the fly Phalacrotophora halictorum. The parasitism occurs during the fly's courtship behavior. After copulation, female flies enter the nest of L. figueresi when the female host is not present. Male flies continue courting the females even after initial copulation and therefore follow the female into the nest, taking it over. Another potential parasite is fungi which either cause or contribute to death. Solitary female nests are as parasitized as two-female nests. Other potential enemies of L. figueresi are species of Conopidae, Sphecodes, and Mutillidae. Sometimes ants invade nests and destroy brood during their scavenging.\n\nL. figueresi defend their nest from parasitism primarily by guarding the nest to prevent the flies from entering, but they also create extra, empty brood cells. These empty cells cause greater difficulty for parasites in finding the larvae of L. figueresi.",

It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Myanmar, where it occupies limestone caves along rivers.\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat is the smallest species of bat and arguably the world's smallest mammal by body length (the Etruscan shrew is regarded as the smallest by body mass). It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies range greatly in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.\n\nAlthough the bat's status in Myanmar is not well known, the Thai population is restricted to a single province and may be at risk of extinction. Its potential threats are primarily anthropogenic, and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Kitti's hog-nosed bat is small at about 29 to 33 mm (1.1 to 1.3 in) in length and 2 g (0.071 oz) in mass, hence the common name of \"bumblebee bat\". It is the smallest species of bat and may be the world's smallest mammal, depending on how size is defined. The main competitors for the title are small shrews; in particular, the Etruscan shrew may be lighter at 1.2 to 2.7 g (0.042 to 0.095 oz) but its body is longer, measuring 36 to 53 mm (1.4 to 2.1 in) from its head to the base of the tail.\n\nThe bat has a distinctive swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur. In the jaw, the premaxillae are not fused with surrounding bones, and the coronoid process is significantly reduced. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.\n\nThe bat's upperparts are reddish-brown or grey, while the underside is generally paler. The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips that allow the bat to hover. The second digit of the wing is made of a single short phalanx. And the humerus has an increased number of locking tubercles on its head and beyond. There is a considerable fusion in the axial skeleton, concerning the thoracic (three posterior vertebrae), lumbar (two posterior) and sacral (all) sections. The bat has particularly slender legs, with rather thin fibula. Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti's hog-nosed bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, although there are no tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat occupies limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. In Thailand, it is restricted to a small region of the Tenasserim Hills in Sai Yok District, Kanchanaburi Province, within the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River. While Sai Yok National Park in the Dawna Hills contains much of the bat's range, some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore unprotected.\n\nSince the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Myanmar, at least nine separate sites have been identified in the limestone outcrops of the Dawna and Karen Hills outside the Thanlwin, Ataran, and Gyaing Rivers of Kayin and Mon States. The Thai and Myanmar populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.\n\nDespite its restricted geographical range and specialized habitat requirements, Kitti's hog-nosed bat exhibits remarkable genetic diversity within its populations. Molecular analyses using microsatellite markers have revealed moderate levels of genetic differentiation among cave roosts in Thailand and Myanmar, suggesting historical isolation and limited gene flow between populations.\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat roosts in caves in limestone hills, far from the entrance. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat suggest a unique reproductive strategy characteristic of microchiropterans. Females of this species typically give birth to a single offspring per reproductive event, with births occurring during the dry season between March and May. Maternity colonies composed of a small number of females are formed within cave roosts, providing communal protection and thermoregulatory benefits for nursing offspring. Male mating behaviors, such as courtship vocalizations and scent marking, have been documented in captive populations, indicating potential sexual selection mechanisms.\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat is the only extant species in the family Craseonycteridae, which is grouped in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea as a result of molecular testing. Based on this determination, the bat's closest relatives are members of the families Hipposideridae and Rhinopomatidae.\n\nKitti's hog-nosed bat was unknown to the world at large prior to 1974. Its common name refers to its discoverer, Thai zoologist Kitti Thonglongya. Thonglongya worked with a British partner, John E. Hill, in classifying bats of Thailand; after Thonglongya died suddenly in February 1974, Hill formally described the species, giving it the binomial name Craseonycteris thonglongyai in honour of his colleague.\n\nAs a microchiropteran species, Kitti's hog-nosed bat plays a crucial ecological role in its habitat, primarily as an insectivore. This species preys predominantly on small flying insects, including mosquitoes, moths, and beetles. By controlling insect populations, particularly those of agricultural pests and disease vectors, Kitti's hog-nosed bat contributes to ecosystem balance and human well-being. Furthermore, its presence in cave ecosystems may also influence nutrient cycling and the distribution of guano-dependent organisms.\n\nAs of the species'  review in 2019, Kitti's hog-nosed bat is listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, with a downward population trend.\n\nSoon after the bat's discovery in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed as a result of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.\n\nCurrently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a gas pipeline from Myanmar to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Myanmar population are not well known.\n\nIn 2007, Kitti's hog-nosed bat was identified by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered  project as one of its Top 10 \"focal species\".",

It lives in the deserts of Central Asia, averaging  2 centimetres (0.8 in) at birth and 5 centimetres (2.0 in) and 20–25 grams (0.71–0.88 oz) during adulthood. Distinguishing characteristics of the Roborovskis are eyebrow-like white spots and the lack of any dorsal stripe (found on the other members of the genus Phodopus). The average lifespan for the Roborovski hamster is 2–4 years, though this is dependent on living conditions (extremes being four years in captivity and two in the wild). Roborovskis are known for their speed and have been said to run up to 6 miles a night.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Roborovski hamsters are found in desert regions, such as the basin of the lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan and regions of Tuva, Mongolia and Xinjiang in China. The hamsters inhabit areas of loose sand and sparse vegetation and are rarely found in areas of dense vegetation and solid clay substrates. They live at elevations of around 1,200 metres (3,900 ft)–1,450 metres (4,760 ft) and although research has been carried out, no fossil record exists for this species. Their efficient use of water makes them particularly suited to the steppe and desert regions they inhabit. They dig and live in burrows with steep tunnels as deep as six feet underground. In the wild, Roborovski hamsters are crepuscular, being most active at dawn and dusk.\n\nThe Roborovski hamster has been found to be more common in the southern area of its distribution range, in areas such as Yulin, Shaanxi, China. It has been reported as a common sighting by locals in this city and in the sand dunes of the Ordos Desert.\n\nThey are omnivorous; they primarily eat grains, vegetables, fruit, and plants, but they will also eat meat and insects when present. Roborovski hamsters remain underground in winter and survive in that season by stockpiling some food in warmer weather and storing it in special food chambers within their burrow system. \nIn the Chinese province of Shaanxi it is known for foraging millet seeds.\n\nIn Mongolia, insects like beetles, earwigs and crickets are part of its diet. According to Formosow the stock of several burrows indicate an almost insect-based diet. Also the consumption of snails has been reported.\n\nIn Tuva, the share of animal food is marginal. It primarily lives on the seed of the sand alyssum, nitre bush, Siberian peashrub, Dracocephalum peregrinum, and milkvetch as well as sedges during the summer-months. Vegetative plant parts are not of significance. Flint and Golowkin determined in 1958 and 1959 that nearly 100 percent of the cheek pouches' content consisted of plant food, whereas animal food was only found in 23 percent of the hamsters' pouches at all in 1958 and 32  percent in 1959.\n\nThe daily dietary intake of the Roborovski hamster heavily depends on its body weight. Juveniles have higher intakes of food compared to their weight than adult hamsters. Based on its population structure, Wan et al. calculated an average food intake of ca. two gram plant seeds per day. They specify the functional relation between the daily food intake (N) and the body-weight (M) to be \n\n\n\nN\n=\n(\n1,422\n⋅\nln\n⁡\n(\nM\n\n/\n\n\ngram\n\n)\n−\n1,780\n)\n\n gram\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N=(1{,}422\\cdot \\ln(M/{\\text{gram}})-1{,}780){\\text{ gram}}}\n\n\n\nPups, juveniles as well as adult hamsters, are foraging food in their burrows.\n\nRussian expeditioner Lt. Vsevolod Roborovski first made note of these hamsters, discovering them on an expedition in July 1894, though they were not studied scientifically for the best part of another decade, until Konstantin A. Satunin made observations in 1903. The London Zoo imported them into the UK in the 1960s, but the first Roborovski hamsters studied in Britain were imported in the 1970s from Moscow Zoo. (None of them, however, bore offspring.) Continental European countries had more success in breeding some Roborovskis, and those currently in the UK are descendants of a batch imported from the Netherlands in 1990. They were imported to the US in 1998, though they are now commonly found in pet shops in several countries. In South Korea, they are almost as common as the Winter White Russian dwarf hamster.\n\nThe Roborovski hamster is distinguished from the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli) due to its smaller size, sandy coloration of fur and its lack of a dorsal stripe. When observed from behind, the neurocranium is rounded and does not appear to be as rectangular as Phodopus campbelli and Phodopus sungorus. The cusps of the lower molars are directly opposite and not alternate, as seen in other members of the genus, and the incisive foramen of the Roborovski hamster is greater than 4 millimetres (0.16 in) in length and is shorter than the length of the upper tooth row, which is uncharacteristic of the other two members of the genus.\n\nCurrently, 10 variations of Roborovski hamsters are thought to exist.\nOnly one is standardised in the UK as of 2018 as per UK National Hamster Council, with 4 genes recognised and others still under dispute.\n\nBreeding in captivity has also produced a darker variation of the naturally sandy-coloured agouti fur. According to Fox (2006) white-faced and derived breeds are considered torture-breeding and therefore breeding them is forbidden by law in several European countries like Germany or Austria. The homozygous carrier of the gene variant causes neurological symptoms similar to the whirling disease, where the animal spins itself around until it dies of exhaustion.\n\nThis concern is not seen in recessive white face (husky).\n\nThe sex of a Roborovski is determined visually; female openings are very close together and may even look like a single opening, while male openings are further apart. Males usually have a visible scent gland near the navel above the two openings, appearing as a yellow stain in older animals.\n\nThe breeding season for the Roborovski hamster is between April and September. Gestation lasts from 20 and 22 days, producing three to four litters. The litter size is between three and nine, with an average of six. Captive-bred Roborovski often breed year round.\n\nThe offspring weigh 1.2 grams (0.042 oz)–2 grams (0.071 oz) at birth. At birth, the offspring have no fur, the incisors and claws are visible, but the eyes, pinnae of the ear and digits are all sealed. After three days the whiskers become visible, and after five days the first dorsal hairs develop. The digits separate after six days, and after eleven days the body is completely formed. The young hamsters open their eyes by day 14.\n\nRoborovski hamsters have become increasingly popular as pets in recent years. They are best suited to life as merely observational creatures, with limited interaction between them and humans, due to their increased activity levels that lead to a high stress predisposition and decreased ease of handling when compared to other domestic hamster species. However, they can be tamed with time.\n\nOn average, Roborovski hamsters will live 26 months in captivity.\n\nAlthough claimed to be hypoallergenic, Roborovski hamsters have been associated with the development of asthma in previously asymptomatic owners.\n\nIn rare emergency situations, a shallow dish of warm water may be necessary to clean harmful substances from a hamster's fur; however, under normal circumstances, hamsters should never be bathed in water as, aside from being incredibly stressful, this can remove vital protective oils from their coat, which can be dangerous and potentially fatal. Hamsters frequently groom themselves, and instead of water, a sand bath should be offered to help them stay clean and healthy.\n\nUnlike other species of hamster (see 'Syrian hamster behavior'), Roborovski hamsters can sometimes be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups if raised together from a young age. A single or pair of Roborovski hamsters should be kept in a cage of minimum 50 x 100 cm, or the equivalent of 0.5 sq metres with at least 15–20 cm of substrate, so that they may exercise their natural urge to burrow. However, greater floor space and substrate depth is recommended for all species of hamsters, where \"bigger is always better\" . Additional levels do not count toward the base area. Aquariums and DIY enclosures are commonly used amongst hamster enthusiasts, often preferred for their capability to hold greater amounts of substrate, availability, and cost, amongst various other reasons, over traditional wire cages (see images for examples).\n\nIf fighting within a group occurs, the hamsters should be separated immediately to avoid injury.\nRoborovski hamsters are very active, so a species-appropriate wheel is a necessity. Size is still debated, but the general consensus is that a wheel should be at least 16.5 cm (6.5 inches. Other sources recommend a minimum diameter of 20 cm(8 inches).\n\nRoborovski hamsters, like many rodents, will naturally avoid large open spaces, opting to stick close to the walls if forced into the open, where they feel safest. Providing them with multiple hiding spots is vital. This can be achieved by placing branches, tunnels and various other hides in close arrangement.\n\nBased on their natural diet, owners should feed hamster food containing mainly grains and small seeds. Animal protein should also be offered, in form of mealworms, grasshoppers or other insects. Dried insects may be offered in lieu of live prey. Some hamsters also accept seafood such as dried gammarus.\n\nTo support their natural behaviour of foraging and stockpiling, feed should be scattered around the enclosure, hidden in several spots, or slightly buried beneath the substrate (approximately 1tsp of food per hamster per day).\n\nFoods to avoid include:\n\nFresh water should be available at all times. A bowl is preferable to a bottle, as it encourages a more natural and comfortable drinking posture.\n\nHamsters' incisors never stop growing and they have a ‘self-sharpening’ system where the incisors grind against each other while gnawing, which wears the teeth down; so chew toys are essential.\n\nNesting materials should be easily shreddable and digestible, such as unscented toilet paper, moss, hay or leaves.\n\nAvoid materials that separate into thin strands when chewed (such as cotton wool or similar 'fluffy' bedding products), as entanglement or ingestion poses a serious health risk to hamsters. Softwood shavings (such as pine or cedar) are also unsuitable as they contain harmful chemicals that can damage a hamster's respiratory system. Hardwood shavings such as aspen are safe to use.\n\nTo provide a means of cleaning itself and to help mimic its natural habitat, a large bowl of sand should be available at all times. Sand bathing is a vital part of a hamster's daily routine and helps to keep their coat healthy by removing excess oils. The sand can be kept clean by sieving or washing out with water and drying. Unused children's play sand is a viable option for this.\n\nSand must be dust-free. Chinchilla sand is too dusty for hamsters and can cause respiratory problems. Bird sand is also not suitable as it contains shards of broken shell.\n\nThe short film Roborovski, about a hamster, co-written and directed by Tilda Cobham-Hervey and Dev Patel, premiered at Flickerfest in Sydney in January 2020, and won several awards at the Antipodean Film Festival in Saint Tropez, France, in 2021.",

Giant salamanders constitute one of two living families—the other being the Asiatic salamanders belonging to the family Hynobiidae—within the Cryptobranchoidea, one of two main divisions of living salamanders.\n\nThe largest species are in the genus Andrias, native to east Asia. The South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi), can reach a length of 1.8 m (5.9 ft). The Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) reaches up to 1.44 m (4.7 ft) in length, feeds at night on fish and crustaceans, and has been known to live for more than 50 years in captivity.\n\nThe hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) inhabits the eastern United States and is the only member of the genus Cryptobranchus.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The family name is from the Ancient Greek krypto (\"hidden\"), and branch (\"gill\"), which refer to how the members absorb oxygen through capillaries of their side-frills, which function as gills.\n\nClade Pancryptobrancha (Cryptobranchidae + Ukrainurus)\n\nThe following phylogeny is based on Vasilyan et al. (2013):\n\n†Ukrainurus\n\nCryptobranchus\n\n†Aviturus\n\n†Zaissanurus\n\nAndrias\n\nThe well-represented Cretaceous Eoscapherpeton was not phylogenetically placed. The enigmatic \"Cryptobranchus\" saskatchewanensis of Paleocene Canada may actually represent a stem-cryptobranchid.\n\nCryptobranchids are large and predominantly nocturnal salamanders that can reach a length of 1.8 m (5.9 ft), though most are considerably smaller today. Despite being aquatic, they are poor swimmers and mostly just walk on the bottom. Swimming by undulatory locomotion is generally used just for short distance-escapes to hiding places. The body is stout with large folds of skin along the flanks and a heavy, laterally compressed tail. These folds help increase the animals' surface area, allowing them to absorb more oxygen from the water as the adults lacks gills and have poorly developed lungs. Like in the majority of salamander species, there are four toes on the fore limbs and five on the hind limbs. They have paedomorphic traits, meaning their metamorphosis from the larval stage is incomplete, so they lack eyelids and the adults retain gill slits (open in the hellbender, closed in Andrias). Eyes are small and the eyesight bad.\n\nIn Japan, their natural habitats are threatened by dam-building.  Ramps and staircases have been added to some dams to allow them to move upstream to areas where they spawn.\n\n\nA Japanese giant salamander lived for 52 years in captivity.\n\nThe Chinese giant salamander eats aquatic insects, fish, frogs, crabs, and shrimp. They hunt mainly at night.  As they have poor eyesight, they use sensory nodes on their heads and bodies to detect minute changes in water pressure, enabling them to find their prey.\n\nDuring mating season, the salamanders travel upstream, where the female lays two strings of over 200 eggs each. Lacking the stereotypical courtship behaviors found in other species, the male fertilizes the eggs externally by releasing his sperm onto them, and then guards them for at least three months, until they hatch. Tail fanning also occurs in order to increase the oxygen supply for the eggs. At this point, the larvae live off their noticeable stored fat until ready to hunt. Once ready, they hunt as a group rather than individually.\n\nScientists at Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park in Japan have recently discovered the male salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den. Only large males can occupy and guard a den. They guard the den against other males and sexually inactive females. Those that are sexually active are welcomed. On occasion, the male \"den master\" will also allow a second male (smaller male salamanders, named \"satellite males\", who do not have their own den) into the den; the reason for this is unclear.\n\nExtant species in the family Cryptobranchidae are the modern-day members of a lineage that extends back tens of millions of years. The oldest known fossils of cryptobranchoids are known from the Middle Jurassic of China. Chunerpeton from the Middle Jurassic of China has been suggested to represent the oldest known cryptobranchid. However, some studies have found it to be a more basal cryptobranchoid not more closely related to Cryptobranchidae than to Hynobiidae. The next oldest cryptobranchid is Eoscapherpeton, known from numerous Late Cretaceous deposits in Central Asia, which is suggested to represent a stem-group to modern cryptobranchids. Modern crown group representatives appear during the Paleocene.\n\nAs the fossil record for the Cryptobranchidae shows an Asian origin for the family, how these salamanders made it to the eastern US has been a point of scientific interest. Research has indicated a dispersal via land bridge, with waves of adaptive radiation seeming to have swept the Americas from north to south.\n\nIn 1726, the Swiss physician Johann Jakob Scheuchzer described a fossil as Homo diluvii testis (Latin: Evidence of a diluvian human), believing it to be the remains of a human being who drowned in the biblical flood. The Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands, bought the fossil in 1802, where it is still exhibited. In 1812, the fossil was examined by Georges Cuvier, who recognized that it was not human. After being identified as a salamander, it was renamed Salamandra scheuchzeri by Holl in 1831. The genus Andrias was coined six years later by Tschudi. In doing so, both the genus, Andrias (which means \"image of man\"), and the specific name, scheuchzeri, ended up honouring Scheuchzer and his beliefs. It and the extant A. davidianus cannot be mutually distinguished, and the latter, only described in 1871, is therefore sometimes considered a synonym of the former.",

The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1 m (3.3 ft) long, the epaulette shark has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.\n\nEpaulette sharks have nocturnal habits and frequent shallow water on coral reefs or in tidal pools. This shark has evolved to cope with the severe night time oxygen depletion (hypoxia) in isolated tidal pools by increasing the blood supply to its brain and selectively shutting down non-essential neural functions. It is capable of surviving complete anoxia for two hours without ill effects, and at a much higher temperature than most other hypoxia-tolerant animals. Rather than swim, epaulette sharks often \"walk\" by wriggling their bodies and pushing with their paired fins. This species feeds on a wide range of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. Epaulette sharks are oviparous, with females depositing pairs of egg capsules around every 14 days from August to December. Due to their hardiness and small size, epaulette sharks are popular with both public and home aquaria. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern, as outside of the small aquarium trade it is of little interest to fisheries.",

      "sections":"The epaulette shark was originally described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum. The type specimen was a 35 cm (14 in) long immature male caught near Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for Brachaelurus waddi). Goto's 2002 morphological analysis of the carpet sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy, meaning that the phylogenetic relationships between the epaulette shark and its sister species could not be resolved.\n\nThe range of the epaulette shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, as far south as Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50 m (160 ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.\n\nThe epaulette shark has an elongated body, over half of which is comprised by the slender caudal peduncle. The snout is short and rounded, with the nares placed almost at the tip along with a pair of tiny barbels; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 26–35 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 21–32 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large spiracle below each. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.\n\nThe pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly sized dorsal fins are placed well back on the body. The anal fin is low and positioned just in front of the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 70–90 cm (27.5–35.5 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107 cm (42 in).\n\nAs an adaptation for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing off of the substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait is similar to that of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.\n\nEpaulette sharks are preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks. Its coloration provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated to be an eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect the health of the shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.\n\nAt night, the shallow reef platforms inhabited by the epaulette shark often become isolated from the ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30 °C (86 °F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.\n\nThe physiological responses of the epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant and there is no elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.\n\nEpaulette shark development rate and fitness are strongly affected by temperature during development. Temperature rises due to climate change are sufficient to weaken the sharks, which risks damage to ecosystems.\n\nThe epaulette shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the epaulette shark's diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly the former and adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur at any time during the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 5–10 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.\n\nMating in the epaulette shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be initiated by the female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about one and a half minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20–50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120–130 days, at a length of 14–16 cm (5.5–6.5 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2.0 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54–64 cm (21.5–25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.\n\nEpaulette sharks are harmless to humans, though if handled they may nip their captors. They are easily observed and handled by beachgoers as they move slowly whilst out of water, and show little fear of humans; the shark is often injured by these encounters. This species adapts readily to captivity and is displayed by many public aquariums in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In an article for Aquarium Fish Magazine, Scott W. Michael referred to the epaulette shark as \"the best shark for the home aquarium.\" They will breed in captivity, even in tanks as small as 510 L (135 gal), though full-grown sharks are best housed in tanks of 680 L (180 gal) or more. They are not compatible with community tanks as they will eat other fish.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the epaulette shark as of Least Concern. This species is common in Australian waters, where it is not captured by either commercial or recreational fisheries, and is minimally affected by collection for the aquarium trade and fishery bycatch. Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the epaulette shark has been assessed as Near Threatened, as there it faces habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices, and over-exploitation by artisan fishers.\n\nIn 2015, the behaviour of an epaulette shark was filmed in detail by the BBC for the first episode of a new documentary series named Shark, released around the 40th anniversary of Jaws. The documentary shows an epaulette shark's ability to walk over land, and its hunting behaviours in the ebbing tide.",

It is a nocturnal species occurring in low vegetation in mature forests only. It is not considered threatened overall by the IUCN although deforestation and pollution are potential threats, as is chytridiomycosis.\n\nThe word \"prosoblepon\" originates from the Greek words \"proso\" and \"blepo\", which respectively mean \"forward, in front\" and \"see, look”, and is thought to signify the frontal position of the eyes in the emerald glass frog.",

      "sections":"Centrolene prosoblepon is listed as least concern according to IUCN in the red list category and criteria when it was assessed in 2020. It was listed as least concern because of its wide distribution, large population, and its improbable decline. The emerald glass frog has a lifespan of more than 5 years.[citation needed] It is physically described to be small, green, and may occasionally have dark spots on its back.[citation needed] It has a translucent body for camouflage, green bones and both males and females have humeral hooks (larger in males) which they use for fighting. [citation needed] It is native to Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.[citation needed] It breeds during rainy season (May to November) and the males tend to be territorial. The space between male territories are dependent on calling.[citation needed] As for calling, the males will call from leaf branches.[citation needed]\n\nEspadarana prosoblepon is considered to be medium in size, measuring 2.1-2.8 cm in males and 2.5-3.1 cm in females.[citation needed] During the tadpole phase, its length is around 1.2 cm and has dorsal eyes and nostrils.[citation needed] It is distinguished from the other glass frogs by having a protruding humeral spine in males and membranes between fingers 3 and 4 of its hand.[citation needed] In terms of sexual dimorphism; males have humeral hooks.[citation needed] In terms of size, males are around 0.11g, and snout to vent are about 2.5 cm.[citation needed] Male body size and humeral spine size is different among individuals, but these qualities don't determine success during aggressive interactions.[citation needed] The head of Espadarana prosoblepon is wide and seems round when observed overhead.[citation needed] Its eyes are large and protruding with a small space between the eyes.[citation needed] It does not have a tympanum (or cannot be seen).[citation needed] It has vomerine teeth and due to its translucent smooth skin, its bones and intestines are visible (intestines less so due to white membrane cover).[citation needed] Its fingers vary in length (finger 1 is longer than finger 2) and are webbed.[citation needed]\n\nWhile the morphology of Espadarana prosoblepon is relatively consistent, its coloration pattern is especially variable.[citation needed] These variable patterns and colorations include populations that are yellow, black and green.[citation needed] During the tadpole phase its color is black and then later changes to brown/red. Its dorsal exteriors are emerald green (hence the name) and may have black specks.[citation needed] The color of its fingers is faintly paler than the rest of its body and its bones are green due to biliverdin presence.[citation needed] The iris is usually gray or silver with dark outlines.[citation needed]\n\nThe emerald green frog, like most other frogs, are oviparous and polygynandrous. Their mating season lasts from May to November, which is the wet season in their region. [citation needed] Some studies suggest that there is a positive correlation between rainfall and number of clutches laid.[citation needed]\n\nMales tend to have high fidelity to their ovipository sites. During mating season, the male establishes his territory in a tree, usually on a leaf, and emits a call to attract females to his site. He defends this territory throughout the time he is searching for a mate as well as after the eggs are deposited for a period of time. [citation needed] When a female approaches, the male engages her in amplexus and continues calling. This lasts for about 174 minutes and the calls are strongest during amplexus and after egg deposition.[citation needed] The mating pair may stay in one location or move up to 2 m away from the original site. [citation needed] Males generally tend to one clutch at a time, but have been reported to tend to up to four at a time. [citation needed] The female deposits her eggs on the upper side of a leaf, a mossy rocks or branches, generally 0–3 m above the water. [citation needed] Once the female deposits her eggs they are fertilized by the male's sperm, the male may rub his legs on the sides of the female's body, and she may stay for minutes or hours, and then leaves without returning. [citation needed] Although large male size does not seem to be correlated with mating success, larger females tend to lay clutches with more eggs in them. This reproductive behavior is generally constant throughout emerald glass frog's range. [citation needed]\n\nThese frogs begin as eggs laid on land, develop as aquatic tadpoles, then return to land in their adult life stage. After deposition, the eggs take 8–20 days to develop. Tadpoles drop into the water underneath them and are often born when it is raining, which is said to be a camouflage technique. The hatchlings are 12mm in length, and have specialized mouth parts for attaching to substrate in the stream. After hatching they congregate and remain in the leaf litter and sediment for several months and once they are fully developed into adults they become terrestrial animals. [citation needed]\n\nEggs are laid in clutches of 10 to 40 eggs and are black in color, and each about 10mm in diameter. [citation needed] The eggs are deposited together and form a jelly covered monolayer that is usually about 50 mm in diameter. [citation needed]\n\nFemales generally exhibit less parental care than males do. A female may remain near her eggs for a period of time up to several hours after deposition, but males have been reported to guard the eggs as they guard their territory. There has been no evidence that female parental care benefits the clutch, whereas male parental care has been seen to increase success. [citation needed]\n\nEmerald glass frogs prefer humid terrestrial or aquatic habitats in rainforests and wet forests. They have both terrestrial and aquatic life stages, so they tend to live in vegetation beside streams. They prefer shallow streams because there are more rocks and logs that have vegetation on them for depositing eggs, where less flooding occurs. [citation needed]\n\nThe range of the emerald glass frog is from eastern Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, to the Pacific slopes of Colombia and Ecuador. [citation needed] In Colombia, it is found in the northern and eastern areas (along Cordillera Oriental and in the Magdalena Valley). [citation needed] It is also found along the Caribbean and along the Pacific slopes. [citation needed] It is frequently recorded in Costa Rica. [citation needed] It has declined drastically in Monteverde, Costa Rica since the mid 1980s. [citation needed] While this may require further investigation, recorded declines in Costa Rica might be due to the chytridiomycosis disease. [citation needed] Different Costa Rican populations have shown stability and, in some places, (Zarcero for example), the emerald glass frog is the most common glass frog within the area. [citation needed] Moreover, it is shown to be common in Panama, Nicaragua, Ecuador and reasonably common in Honduras and Colombia. [citation needed] It currently has a stable population trend and is not considered to be fragmented. [citation needed] Strong site fidelity has been shown by the emerald glass frog, and its preferred system is terrestrial and freshwater. [citation needed] As for the home range; the emerald glass frog shows strong fidelity within around 2 meters, and it is suggested that migration is a possibility. [citation needed] Furthermore, studies have shown that the activity of males and females increased with rainfall. [citation needed]\n\nThe frog's range includes at least one protected park, including the Ranita Dorada Amphibian Reserve.\n\nCentrolene prosoblepon is found at elevations ranging from 20-1,500 meters in zones that are humid such as forests and rainforests. [citation needed] It appears to be more common at higher altitudes due to the presence of more stream habitats near rivers and streams. [citation needed] It has been found that the maximum elevation limit 1500 meters (above sea level). [citation needed] In terms of habitat in these altitudes, the emerald glass frog prefers vegetated areas that are dense such as evergreen forests along banks of rapid streams where it breeds by laying its eggs on nearby leaves. [citation needed]\n\nThe emerald glass frog's activity is nocturnal, and increased during rainfall.[citation needed] Males are territorial and have high site fidelity which can lead to aggression. In the event of combat, males have humeral hooks that they use for grappling with other males. [citation needed]\n\nAdults are carnivorous, primarily eating insects, whereas tadpoles can be both carnivorous and herbivorous. Tadpoles eat algae, aquatic invertebrates as well as other tadpoles. [citation needed]\n\nMale emerald glass frogs have large humeral spines that they use for combat. The size varies amongst individuals and tends to be correlated with who wins the interaction. [citation needed] If a male's territory is encroached upon the two males will engage in a grappling match that can last up to 30 minutes. [citation needed] This is more common in areas of high male density than in areas of low male density. [citation needed] Males in combat hang by their toes on the same or nearby vegetation and seize each other front to front, hooking their humeral hooks in the other's axial region. When this ritual is over, the males may make a peep sound, or simply jump to another location on the tree.[citation needed] The aggressive interaction is over when one male jumps to another (lower) leaf or flattens his body against the leaf signifying submissiveness. [citation needed]\n\nThough most vocal during the wet season, it has been reported that these frogs call throughout the year. [citation needed] The call is used to attract a female to his territory and consists of short “chee-chee-chee”, with intermittent chirp sequences. The rate of this call ranges from 1 to 43 calls per hour, with a duration of 1.5–3 seconds. [citation needed] The call is most intense whilst engaged in amplexus as well as after egg deposition. [citation needed] When a male is in close proximity to another male, they call in a short series of rapid beeps. [citation needed] Higher mating success has been seen to be correlated to longer length of calling. [citation needed]\n\nIn the past thirty years there has been a major decline (about 40%) in amphibian populations in South America, with the emerald tree frog among them. This sudden population drop was strange and perplexing because there was very little disturbance in the area. After some research in the affected areas, there was speculation that the decline was a result of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes chytridiomycosis in amphibians. Espadarana prosoblepon populations have remained relatively stable after the major population decline, keeping them on the IUCN species of least concern list. [citation needed][citation needed][citation needed]\n\nThe emerald glass frog substantially declined in Monteverde, Costa Rica since the 1980s, though it has shown stability in other near areas. [citation needed] There may be multiple causes for the decline including habitat destruction, negative agriculture, chemical implementation and disease. [citation needed] Centrolene prosoblepon is threatened by Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) which causes chytridiomycosis that disrupts its skin and respiratory system. [citation needed] Some frogs tend to be less threatened by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis due to the variation in their physiology. [citation needed] The emerald glass frog was able to persist during its decline which indicates high resistance to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. [citation needed] Another threat is a chytrid collapse, which is when the majority of the population rapidly declines while a few persist. [citation needed] There is very little information regarding predation but crabs and other small predators such as spiders have been reported to feed on Centrolene prosoblepon. [citation needed] Generally, threats to the emerald glass frogs are related to its habitat such as deforestation, human intrusion and pollution resulting from illegal crop spraying. [citation needed]\n\nAn example of conserving Centrolene prosoblepon is evident in Ecuador because its distribution overlaps with reserves such as the Mache-Chindul Ecological Reserve and the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve. [citation needed] It is also found in many protected areas in Colombia and within its range in Central America. [citation needed] The emerald glass frog generally has a wide distribution and consists of large populations which is why it has not attracted conservation efforts. [citation needed]",

      "introduction":"\n\nFormica polyctena is a species of European red wood ant in the genus Formica and large family Formicidae. The species was first described by Arnold Förster in 1850. The latin species name polyctena is from Greek and literally means 'many cattle', referring to the species' habit of farming aphids for honeydew food. It is found in many European countries. It is a eusocial species, that has a distinct caste system of sterile workers and a very small reproductive caste. The ants have a genetic based cue that allow them to identify which other ants are members of their nest and which are foreign individuals. When facing these types of foreign invaders the F. polyctena has a system to activate an alarm. It can release pheromones which can trigger an alarm response in other nearby ants.\n\nIt is found in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, \nFinland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Formica polyctena like many ant, wasp and bee species, displays a eusocial system. Eusocial insects are characterized by cooperative care of young among members of a colony, distinct caste systems where some individuals breed and most individuals are sterile helpers, and overlapping generations so mother, adult offspring and immature offspring are all living at the same time. In a eusocial colony, an individual is assigned a specialized caste before they become reproductively mature, which makes them behaviorally distinct from other castes.  Red wood ants exhibit all of these characteristics, with queens and males that make up the reproductive caste and sterile female workers that aid in brood care and colony maintenance.\n\nWorkers in ant colonies are typically sterile females that do not reproduce. F. polyctena is consistent with this model, with almost completely sterile workers that do not lay eggs. This is in contrast to other Formica species that have workers that actually do reproduce, disrupting the eusocial system. F. polyctena’s high proportion of worker sterility indicates a strict obligate polygynous colony structure that most likely allows for a stable unicoloniality, or the cooperation of several nests. In other words, workers do not have the ability to disrupt the strict social segregation of reproduction by reproducing themselves. Thus they uphold a multi-queen, multi-nest cooperation that may not be advantageous to their genes since they act altruistically toward non-kin.\n\nIn F. polyctena colonies, there appears to be a separate group of designated foraging workers. The number of foragers correlates with the size of the colony. Foragers also tend to be older workers.  However, if foragers are lost or die, other workers from the nest can replace them, indicating some flexibility in designated roles within the colony. These replacement workers have a shorter life expectancy as foragers, indicating that there could be some physiological development as the workers age that allows them to be effective foragers.\n\nIn order to prevent costly conflict between fellow nestmates or involuntarily altruistic behavior toward ants from a foreign nest, individual ants need to distinguish between their fellow nestmates and foreigners. It has been demonstrated that Formica polyctena uses genetically-based cues as a nestmate recognition mechanism. Since F. polyctena, like all ant species, lives in colonies with high genetic relatedness, this type of mechanism would be successful in distinguishing between colonies. Beye, Neumann and Moritz conducted a study where pairs of ants from different nest were introduced to each other to see if they fought, tolerated or avoided one another. Pairs of ants from the same nests were introduced as well to act as a control. Genetic similarity between these ants was measured as well. A strong positive correlation existed between antagonistic behavior and genetic dissimilarity. Thus, F. polyctena ants mostly likely recognize their fellow workers through some genetically produced signal. Nest populations in close physical proximity to one another did not necessarily demonstrate either extremely aggressive or passive behavior toward each other, indicating that nest proximity does not influence recognition. Additionally, nest distance did not correlate with genetic similarity.  \nEssentially, F. polyctena has adapted some form of genetically-based cue that allows nestmates to distinguish between each other and foreign individuals. Beye, Neumann and Moritz believe that these genetic cues act to keep nest colonies separate in homogenous environments that offer no other nestmate recognition strategies.\n\nAlarm behavior can be triggered in Formica polyctena by the release of pheromones. When ants come across a specific pheromone, they approach the source with jaws wide open, as if confronting a threat.  Specifically in F. polyctena, these chemical alarm signals elicit a response not only within the nest, but along foraging paths. In particular, the formic acid sprayed by ants when attacked can trigger a predator alarm response in nearby ants, gathering reinforcements to attack the predator. In this way, formic acid doubles as a chemical weapon against predators and an alarm signal in F. polyctena.\n\nDue to the close living situation of individuals in a F. polyctena colony, diseases can spread rapidly, causing significant damage to the colony's population. Therefore, F. polyctena has evolved responses to combat the spread of disease. When an individual ant develops an immune response to some disease, the other workers can sense this. The workers decrease mouth-to-mouth exchanges of liquid, and prevent the infected individual from moving around. The healthy workers also increase antennal contact and grooming of the infected ant. This is believed to either remove pathogens from the ant that could cause such an immune response, or act as a \"social vaccination\". Aubert and Richard proposed this social vaccination model, where they argue that if fellow nestmates groom an infected ant, they will be exposed to small amounts of the pathogens or molecules that could trigger an immune response within the healthy individuals. In essence, the healthy individuals develop a resistance to the pathogens carried by the infected individual before the pathogens can spread and infect them.\n\nF. polyctena colonies wage wars on neighboring colonies. During wars, any dead ants are cannibalized by the colonies. These wars occur when food is scarce, usually during the spring months, so that the colonies can effectively feed a new generation of ants. Old workers commonly participate in these wars, due to their lower life expectancy than young workers. Spring wars allow the colonies to produce new generations consisting mainly of reproductives (queens and males) rather than workers. The rare wars during the summer and fall months produce food for new generations of workers instead. These young workers are more likely to survive the winter than the old workers who die in the wars. Essentially, the colonies recycle their food resources in the form of workers. Old workers die and are eaten to give rise to either reproductive or new workers. Even if a colony \"loses\" a war and there is a net loss of workers, the warring still provides food, and thus is beneficial to the colony. However, cannibalism is not an efficient food source unless other food resources are scarce, since one new individual requires more food input than another individual's body can provide.\n\nHaccou and Hemerik studied the effects of the cinnabar moth larvae (Tyria jacobaeae) distribution on predation by F. polyctena. They found that the ants preyed more on larvae when they were on the ground than on plants. The ants also preyed more often on larvae that were concentrated in clusters over ones that were evenly dispersed. This is most likely due to communication between the ants, where when one worker discovers food such as a group of larvae, she alerts fellow workers.\n\nF. polyctena, among other social insects, has developed strategies to maintain a stable interior nest temperature despite temperature fluctuations outside. Nest moisture, solar radiation, heat produced by the metabolic activities of workers, and microbial activity in the nest material all contribute to nest thermoregulation. A stable temperature is especially crucial to the rate of development of larvae and pupae in the nest. Additionally, it has been suggested that the particular construction of the F. polyctena nests allows them to have excellent heat capacity, despite their low density and low heat capacity materials. Essentially, the outer layer of nests consists of pine needles, sap and buds, that absorbs a large amount of solar radiation. The inner core of the nest consists of mostly twigs that act like a thermal \"sponge\" into which external heat is funneled.\n\nNest moisture, solar radiation, heat produced by the metabolic activities of workers, and microbial activity in the nest material all contribute to nest thermoregulation. Dry, exposed F. polyctena nests have higher temperatures during the evening, but lose heat slowly throughout the night. This fluctuation is due to the solar radiation absorbed by the nest and workers during the day. When the workers return in the evening, they have high body temperatures from foraging in the sun that warm the interior of the nest. Dry nests have low external surface temperatures during the night, indicating that the physical nest material effectively retains most of the heat gained during the day. Additionally, because these workers metabolize, they release heat from this process and counteract the heat loss from the nest during the night.\n\nMoist, shaded nests display a different daily temperature pattern than dry nests due to the different conditions. In the evenings, the nest temperature drops and then increases as the night progresses.  Solar radiation does not contribute a lot of heat to the nest. Also, the nest material is not an effective insulator like the dry nest material. Moist nests have high external surface temperatures during the night. Instead, they rely on another curious mechanism to warm the nest: microbial activity within the moist nest material. As the workers inside the nest during the evening raise the temperature of the surroundings, microbial activity increases which heats the nest. Indeed, microbial activity is much higher in nest material than in the surrounding forest floor. Microbial activity is not seen in dry nests because the microbes require water. However, despite this adaptation, moist nests on average have lower internal temperatures than dry nests.\n\nFormica polyctena nest temperature fluctuates seasonally as well. In the spring, there is a dramatic increase in heat production of the nest material, and then a more gradual decrease in the fall. This corresponds with the activity of the ants throughout the year. It is possible that the ants' building activities aerate and provide optimum nutritional conditions for microbial activity, increasing the heat production of the nest well beyond what the ants themselves produce.",

      "sections":"The Jamaican boa is golden-green around the head and along the anterior section of the body, with black zigzag crossbars, becoming black toward the posterior end of its body. The snake's body is quite long, up to 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) in total length.\n\nThe Jamaican boa is primarily nocturnal and arboreal. The species may also display crepuscular activity, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, prey availability, and seasonal activities. During daytime, this species seeks shelter in various locations such as epiphytes, trees, rock crevices, termite nests, or caves. It has been observed at the far end of Portland Cave. This species is also known to bask on rocks following heavy rains and to rest on roads and trails during the evening, suggesting crepuscular behavior under certain conditions.\n\nFound in Jamaica in the Cockpit Country, historically once prevalent throughout much of Jamaica, notably in rural areas, as well as some smaller adjacent islands, such as Goat Islands. However, after the introduction of the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) in 1872, sightings of the snake on the mainland dropped. The snake is known to be elusive, which further complicates its detection.\n\nRecent surveys have failed to confirm the snake's presence on Great Goat Island, an area dominated by dry limestone forest. Comprehensive island-wide surveys have been conducted, indicating the snake's presence in various parishes such as Trelawny, St. Anne, Westmoreland, and Hanover.\n\nThe Jamaican boa is now confined to approximately 1,000.6 km2, about 9% of Jamaica's land area. Habitat fragmentation and human activities have localized and severely fragmented the population. Major strongholds for the boa now appear to be Cockpit Country, Blue Mountains, Yallah Mountains, Hellshire Hills, and Portland Bight, which together account for 93% of the known habitat of the species.\n\nThe foraging behavior of the Jamaican boa is not extensively studied, but the species is known to be an ecological generalist. It employs constriction to subdue and consume a diverse range of prey. The snake utilizes both active and ambush foraging strategies, which vary depending on the habitat structure, available food resources, and its life stage. For instance, it has been observed hanging from branches and vines to prey on emerging bats in the evening.\n\nBirds, particularly black-billed parrots (Amazona agilis) and yellow-billed parrots (Amazona collaria), are significant prey items for the Jamaican boa. This species is also a leading cause of nest failure for these endemic bird species, particularly in forest edge habitats. Invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) are also preyed upon, although their toxins can be fatal to the snake. This species will occasionally enters human dwellings and agricultural areas to hunt for rats and chickens. In captivity, the diet often consists of rats for juveniles and adults, while neonates are typically fed chicks or pre-killed, frozen house mice. These mice are often treated with scents from chicks, lizards, or frogs to stimulate consumption.\n\nThe Jamaican boa is considered a top predator in its ecosystem. It engages in both active and ambush predation, often using vines and tank bromeliads (Aechmea paniculigera) for mobility and camouflage. Observations indicate that the species actively preys on flycatcher nests (Tyrannidae). It has also been identified as a predator of Black-Billed Parrots (Amazona agilis) and Yellow-Billed Parrots (A. collaria) in Cockpit Country, Jamaica.\n\nWhile there is no published data on the species' relative abundance in Jamaica, research suggests that Black-Billed Parrots experience higher rates of nest predation in ecotones compared to forest habitats. This may indicate a correlation between the foraging ecology of the Jamaican boa and edge habitats in Cockpit Country.\n\nLimited information is available on the foraging behavior of the Jamaican boa inside cave systems. Aggressive interactions between male individuals of this species have only been documented in captivity. Additionally, increased levels of aggression from females toward conspecifics have been observed under specific conditions.\n\nThe Jamaican boa's natural populations greatly and constantly declined since the late 19th century, mainly because of predation by introduced species (such as mongooses), human persecution, and habitat destruction. In-situ conservation of the Jamaican boa is seriously hindered by the lack of information on demographic and ecological parameters as well as by a poor understanding of the population structure and species distribution in the wild. This species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: A2ce (v2.3, 1994). A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that a population decline of 20% is expected within the next ten years or three generations, whichever is the longer, due to a decline in the quality and area of occupancy. It is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Year assessed: 1996.\n\nTheir natural habitat is being destroyed, which is forcing them into inhabited areas, where they are captured and killed. Some measures have been taken to afford these animals some protection:",

This rodent prefers wet habitats with subtropical climates, and is commonly observed in grassy clearings and rocky areas at the forest edge. S. teguina is diurnal in the wild.  In laboratory settings, it is predominantly active in the morning, with decreasing activity in the afternoon to evening hours.\n\nS. teguina is small (10–13 grams), with a dark coat, and a short tail.  Its underparts are dark gray-brown to orange-brown. The tail is blackish and lightly haired and its feet are black. It also emits a noticeably strong, musky odor.\n\nS. teguina is predominantly insectivorous, feeding on beetles and other small insects.  Additionally, seeds and fruits make up a small portion of its diet.\n\nS. teguina is often recognized for its unique vocalization behavior.  Both males and females produce vocalizations which are characterized by singing bouts containing both sonic and ultrasonic elements.  Male songs tend to be longer than females, but seem to share similar spectral characteristics.  Although ultrasonic vocalizations have been demonstrated in numerous rodent species, few display vocalizing bouts as continuous and stereotyped as S. teguina.  Because of their length and complexity, these vocalizations have been described as \"song\".  When singing, the mouse rears on its hind legs and extends its neck, facing upward while producing a stereotypical call of up to 10 seconds.  The song is loud, with components audible to humans typically occurring towards the end of the call. The exact function of the singing behavior is not yet well understood, but it is believed to play an important role in social communication.  For this reason, a growing interest has emerged in studying S. teguina in laboratory settings as a potential model for animal language in mammalian species.  Stereotypical calls may provide an adaptive mechanism for the localization of conspecifics, and vocalizations in the ultrasonic range are typically inaudible to most predators. Different brain systems are responsible for the melody of the songs and the coordination of duets with another mouse. The functional role of FOXP2 expression in S. teguina and other vocalizing rodent species has been examined.\n\nMale Alston's singing mice sing to attract mates and to warn off other males of their species from their territories.

It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1837. The generic name Tragelaphus is composed of two Greek words: trag-, meaning a goat; and elaphos, meaning deer. The specific name eurycerus originated from the fusion of eurus (broad, widespread) and keras (an animal's horn). The common name \"bongo\" originated probably from the Kele language of Gabon. The first known use of the name \"bongo\" in English dates to 1861.\n\nBongos are further classified into two subspecies: T. e. eurycerus, the lowland or western bongo, and the far rarer T. e. isaaci, the mountain or eastern bongo, restricted to the mountains of Kenya only. The eastern bongo is larger and heavier than the western bongo. Two other subspecies are described from West and Central Africa, but taxonomic clarification is required. They have been observed to live up to 19 years.\n\nBongos are one of the largest of the forest antelopes. In addition to the deep chestnut colour of their coats, they have bright white stripes on their sides to help with camouflage.\n\nAdults of both sexes are similar in size. Adult height is about 1.1 to 1.3 m (3.6 to 4.3 ft) at the shoulder and length is 2.15 to 3.15 m (7.1 to 10.3 ft), including a tail of 45–65 cm (18–26 in). Females weigh around 150–235 kg (331–518 lb), while males weigh about 220–405 kg (485–893 lb). Its large size puts it as the third-largest in the Bovidae tribe of Strepsicerotini, behind both the common and greater eland by about 300 kg (660 lb), and above the greater kudu by about 40 kg (88 lb).\n\nBoth sexes have heavy spiral horns; those of the male are longer and more massive. All bongos in captivity are from the isolated Aberdare Mountains of central Kenya.\n\nThe bongo sports a bright auburn or chestnut coat, with the neck, chest, and legs generally darker than the rest of the body, especially in males. Coats of male bongos become darker as they age until they reach a dark mahogany-brown colour. Coats of female bongos are usually more brightly coloured than those of males. The eastern bongo is darker in color than the western and this is especially pronounced in older males which tend to be chestnut brown, especially on the forepart of their bodies.\n\nThe smooth coat is marked with 10–15 vertical white-yellow stripes, spread along the back from the base of the neck to the rump. The number of stripes on each side is rarely the same. It also has a short, bristly, brown ridge of dorsal hair from the shoulder to the rump; the white stripes run into this ridge.\n\nA white chevron appears between the eyes, with two large white spots on each cheek. Another white chevron occurs where the neck meets the chest. Bongos have no special secretion glands, so rely likely less on scent to find one another than do other similar antelopes. The lips of a bongo are white, topped with a black muzzle.\n\nBongos have two heavy and slightly spiralled horns that slope over their backs. Bongo males have larger backswept horns, while females have smaller, thinner, and more parallel horns. The size of the horns range between 75 and 99 cm (29.5 and 39 in). The horns of bongos are spiraled, and share this trait with those of the related antelope species of nyalas, sitatungas, bushbucks, kudus, and elands. The horns of bongos twist once.\n\nUnlike deer, which have branched antlers shed annually, bongos and other antelopes have unbranched horns they keep throughout their lives.\n\nLike all other horns of antelopes, the core of a bongo's horn is hollow and the outer layer of the horn is made of keratin, the same material that makes up human fingernails, toenails, and hair. The bongo runs gracefully and at full speed through even the thickest tangles of lianas, laying its heavy spiralled horns on its back so the brush cannot impede its flight. Bongos are hunted for their horns by humans.\n\nLike other forest ungulates, bongos are seldom seen in large groups. Males, called bulls, tend to be solitary, while females with young live in groups of six to eight. Bongos have seldom been seen in herds of more than 20. Gestation is about 285 days (9.5 months), with one young per birth, and weaning occurs at six months. Sexual maturity is reached at 24–27 months. The preferred habitat of this species is so dense and difficult to operate in, that few Europeans or Americans observed this species until the 1960s.\nAs young males mature and leave their maternal groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner and it is rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly pacing back and forth in front of the other male. They seek out females only during mating time. When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.\n\nAlthough mostly nocturnal, they are occasionally active during the day. However, like deer, bongos may exhibit crepuscular behaviour. Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare, a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. Once they find cover, they stay alert and face away from the disturbance, but peek every now and then to check the situation. The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.\n\nWhen in distress, the bongo emits a bleat. It uses a limited number of vocalisations, mostly grunts and snorts; females have a weak mooing contact-call for their young. Females prefer to use traditional calving grounds restricted to certain areas, while newborn calves lie in hiding for a week or more, receiving short visits by the mother to suckle.\n\nThe calves grow rapidly and can soon accompany their mothers in the nursery herds. Their horns grow rapidly and begin to show in 3.5 months. They are weaned after six months and reach sexual maturity at about 20 months.\n\nBongos are found in tropical jungles with dense undergrowth up to an altitude of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) in Central Africa, with isolated populations in Kenya, and these West African countries: Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan.\n\nHistorically, bongos are found in three disjunct parts of Africa: East, Central, and West. Today, all three populations' ranges have shrunk in size due to habitat loss for agriculture and uncontrolled timber cutting, as well as hunting for meat.\n\nBongos favour disturbed forest mosaics that provide fresh, low-level green vegetation.   Such habitats may be promoted by heavy browsing by elephants, fires, flooding, tree-felling (natural or by logging), and fallowing. Mass bamboo die-off provides ideal habitat in East Africa. They can live in bamboo forests.\n\nLike many forest ungulates, bongos are herbivorous browsers and feed on leaves, bushes, vines, bark (bark and pith of rotting trees, grasses/herbs, roots, cereals, and fruits.\n\nBongos require salt in their diets, and are known to regularly visit natural salt licks. Bongos are also known to eat burnt wood after a storm, as a rich source of salt and minerals. This behavior is believed to be a means of getting salts and minerals into their diets. This behavior has also been reported in the okapi. Another similarity to the okapi, though the bongo is unrelated, is that the bongo has a long prehensile tongue which it uses to grasp grasses and leaves.\n\nSuitable habitats for bongos must have permanent water available. As a large animal, the bongo requires an ample amount of food, and is restricted to areas with abundant year-round growth of herbs and low shrubs.\n\nFew estimates of population density are available. Assuming average population densities of 0.25 animals per km2 in regions where it is known to be common or abundant, and 0.02 per km2 elsewhere, and with a total area of occupancy of 327,000 km2, a total population estimate of around 28,000 is suggested. Only about 60% are in protected areas, suggesting the actual numbers of the lowland subspecies may only be in the low tens of thousands. In Kenya, their numbers have declined significantly and on Mount Kenya, they were extirpated within the last decade due to illegal hunting with dogs. Although information on their status in the wild is lacking, lowland bongos are not presently considered endangered.\n\nBongos are susceptible to diseases such as rinderpest, which almost exterminated the species during the 1890s. Tragelaphus eurycerus may suffer from goitre. Over the course of the disease, the thyroid glands greatly enlarge (up to 10 x 20 cm) and may become polycystic. Pathogenesis of goiter in the bongo may reflect a mixture of genetic predisposition coupled with environmental factors, including a period of exposure to a goitrogen. Leopards and spotted hyenas are the primary natural predators (lions are seldom encountered due to differing habitat preferences); pythons sometimes eat bongo calves. Humans prey on them for their pelts, horns, and meat, with the species being a common local source for \"bush meat\". Bongo populations have been greatly reduced by hunting, poaching, and animal trapping, although some bongo refuges exist.\n\nAlthough bongos are quite easy for humans to catch using snares, many people native to the bongos' habitat believed that if they ate or touched bongo, they would have spasms similar to epileptic seizures. Because of this superstition, bongos were less harmed in their native ranges than expected. However, these taboos are said no longer to exist, which may account for increased hunting by humans in recent times.\n\nAn international studbook is maintained to help manage animals held in captivity. Because of its bright colour, it is very popular in zoos and private collections. In North America, over 400 individuals are thought to be held, a population that probably exceeds that of the mountain bongo in the wild.\n\nIn 2000, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) upgraded the bongo to a Species Survival Plan participant, which works to improve the genetic diversity of managed animal populations. The target population for participating zoos and private collections in North America is 250 animals. Through the efforts of zoos in North America, a reintroduction to the population in Kenya is being developed.\n\nAt least one collaborative effort for reintroduction between North American wildlife facilities has already been carried out. In 2004, 18 eastern bongos born in North American zoos gathered at White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida for release in Kenya. White Oak staff members traveled with the bongos to a Mount Kenya holding facility, where they stayed until being reintroduced.\n\nIn the last few decades, a rapid decline in the numbers of wild mountain bongo has occurred due to poaching and human pressure on their habitat, with local extinctions reported in Cherangani and Chepalungu hills, Kenya.\n\nThe Bongo Surveillance Programme, working alongside the Kenya Wildlife Service, have recorded photos of bongos at remote salt licks in the Aberdare Forests using camera traps, and, by analyzing DNA extracted from dung, have confirmed the presence of bongo in Mount Kenya, Eburru, and Mau forests. The programme estimate as few as 140 animals left in the wild – spread across four isolated populations. Whilst captive breeding programmes can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe and North America, the situation in the wild has been less promising. Evidence exists of bongo surviving in Kenya. However, these populations are believed to be small, fragmented, and vulnerable to extinction.\n\nAnimal populations with impoverished genetic diversity are inherently less able to adapt to changes in their environments (such as climate change, disease outbreaks, habitat change, etc.). The isolation of the four remaining small bongo populations, which themselves would appear to be in decline, means a substantial amount of genetic material is lost each generation. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater, so the establishment of a \"metapopulation management plan\" occurs concurrently with conservation initiatives to enhance in situ population growth, and this initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of mountain bongo in the wild.\n\nThe western/lowland bongo faces an ongoing population decline as habitat destruction and hunting pressures increase with the relentless expansion of human settlement. Its long-term survival will only be assured in areas which receive active protection and management. At present, such areas comprise about 30,000 km2, and several are in countries where political stability is fragile. So, a realistic possibility exists whereby its status could decline to Threatened in the near future.\n\nAs the largest and most spectacular forest antelope, the western/lowland bongo is both an important flagship species for protected areas such as national parks, and a major trophy species which has been taken in increasing numbers in Central Africa by sport hunters during the 1990s. Both of these factors are strong incentives to provide effective protection and management of populations.\n\nTrophy hunting has the potential to provide economic justification for the preservation of larger areas of bongo habitat than national parks, especially in remote regions of Central Africa, where possibilities for commercially successful tourism are very limited.\n\nThe eastern/mountain bongo's survival in the wild is dependent on more effective protection of the surviving remnant populations in Kenya. If this does not occur, it will eventually become extinct in the wild. The existence of a healthy captive population of this subspecies offers the potential for its reintroduction.\n\nIn 2004, Dr. Jake Veasey, the head of the Department of Animal Management and Conservation at Woburn Safari Park and a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums Population Management Advisory Group, with the assistance of Lindsay Banks, took over responsibility for the management and coordination of the European Endangered Species Programme for the eastern bongo. This includes some 250 animals across Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAlong with the Rothschild giraffe, the eastern bongo is arguably one of the most threatened large mammals in Africa, with recent estimates numbering less than 140 animals, below a minimum sustainable viable population. The situation is exacerbated because these animals are spread across four isolated populations. Whilst the bongo endangered species program can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe, it has not yet become actively involved in the conservation of this species in the wild in a coordinated fashion. The plan is to engage in conservation activities in Kenya to assist in reversing the decline of the eastern bongo populations and genetic diversity in Africa, and in particular, applying population management expertise to help ensure the persistence of genetic diversity in the free ranging wild populations.\n\nTo illustrate significance of genetic diversity loss, assume the average metapopulation size is 35 animals based on 140 animals spread across four populations (140/4=35). Assuming stable populations, these populations will lose 8% of their genetic diversity every decade. By managing all four populations as one, through strategic transfers, gene loss is reduced from 8% to 2% per decade, without any increase in bongo numbers in Kenya. By managing the European and African populations as one – by strategic exports from Europe combined with in situ transfers, gene loss is reduced to 0.72% every 100 years, with both populations remaining stable. If populations in Kenya are allowed to grow through the implementation of effective conservation, including strategic transfers, gene loss can be effectively halted in this species and its future secured in the wild.\n\nThe initial aims of the project are:\n\nIf effective protection were implemented immediately and bongo populations allowed to expand without transfers, then this would create a bigger population of genetically impoverished bongos. These animals would be less able to adapt to a dynamic environment. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater. For this reason, the 'metapopulation management plan' must occur concurrently with conservation strategies to enhance in situ population growth. This initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of the mountain bongo in the wild.\n\nIn 2013, SafariCom telecommunications donated money to the Bongo Surveillance Programme to try to keep tabs on what are thought to be the last 100 eastern bongos left in the wild in the Mau Eburu Forest in central Kenya, whose numbers are still declining due to logging of their habitat and illegal poaching.\n\nMount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy runs a bongo rehabilitation program in collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service. The Conservancy aims to prevent extinction of the bongo through breeding and release back into the wild.\n\nThe IUCN Antelope Specialist Group considers the western or lowland bongo, T. e. eurycerus, to be Lower Risk (Near Threatened) and the eastern or mountain bongo, T. e. isaaci, of Kenya, to be Critically Endangered. These bongos may be endangered due to human environmental interaction, as well as hunting and illegal actions towards wildlife.\n\nCITES lists bongos as an Appendix III species, only regulating their exportation from a single country, Ghana. It is not protected by the US Endangered Species Act and is not listed by the USFWS.",

Places of interest that the bats tend to gather in the daylight hours are abandoned buildings, dry caves, or baobab trees. They are also found living no higher than 940 meters or 3094 feet in elevation. Heart-nosed bats live in large colonies together, but they are very territorial and do not mingle with other bat species.\n\nHeart-nosed bats weigh 21–35 g (0.74–1.23 oz) and are 70–77 mm (2.8–3.0 in) in length. Heart-nosed bats have blueish/grayish fur. Their fur also hangs off of their body and is considered to be long and loose.  These bats have no tails, unlike most other species of bats. Some of the most recognizable features of this species is its teeth and skull, as well as its heart-shaped nose.\n\nHeart-nosed bats are monogamous. If possible, mates will stay together during multiple mating seasons. Breeding sites are extremely territorial and are typically protected by the males. These sites are set up during the breeding season itself and afterwards it will be taken down. A new breeding site will be found for the next mating season. The female period of gestation is three months. Baby bats are referred to as pups. Heart-nosed bats can only have one pup at a time. Females, like all mammals, feed their young via lactation. Females will carry their newborns until two months of age. After the third month, the pup is weaned from its mother and will then follow the mother around. The pup learns from its mother about foraging and territories that will allow them to be successful later in their life. The father's parental behavior is mostly unknown, but it is thought that the songs and territorial protection is protection of the mother and their young. The prime reproduction months happen between March and June and then again between October and December. These months are in the rainy season months and make the best mating months for heart-nosed bats.\n\nHeart-nosed bats are nocturnal. Depending on when the sun sets, they will wake up and start making their way to their feeding zones. They will typically do this a couple minutes before the sun actually sets. These bats have a strategy called \"hawking\" that allows them to collect bugs. They also use a \"sit-and-wait\" strategy. The sit-and-wait strategy involves hanging from a perch and waiting until an insect comes along to be preyed upon. The sit-and-wait strategy is usually used during the dry season. Hawking is usually used when the wet seasons are happening. During the dry season, the heart-nosed bats diet primarily consists of terrestrial beetles and leaf gleaning. The most common beetles that are fed on are the Scarabaeidae, Tenebrionidae, and the Carabidae. During the wet season, the heart-nosed bat's diet primarily consists of large terrestrial beetles, locusts, katydids, moths, small bats, and frogs. These bats mainly stick to themselves and do not mingle with other species. The cause of this is unknown. There are no known predators that actively seek out heart-nosed bats. However, common predators such as snakes, cats, and owls will prey on the young pups if the opportunity arises. Heart-nosed bats also take time out of the day to groom themselves and others. It is unknown if this helps increase the social bond between the bats as it would in other species.\n\nHeart-nosed bats are extremely beneficial for the ecosystem and environment. They primarily feed on bugs, which allows for insect and pest regulations. Crops that could be easily damaged by pests will be taken care of by the bats. Insect populations that are growing too quickly will also be taken care of. While they are mostly beneficial, there is one negative aspect to the heart-nosed bats in the ecosystem. The heart-nosed bat is a carrier of Borrelia. Borrelia is a bacterium that can cause Lyme disease. This can be transferred to humans, and be given a fever along with the illness.\n\nHeart-nosed bats are one of the first bat species to be heard singing, or vocalizing. Many behaviors of this bat are still unknown but it was found with studies that the heart-nosed bats will cluster together in the daylight hours but then go their separate ways during the night hours. The night hours are when the singing takes place. It was observed that there are two known songs. The more common of the two songs is referred to as a loud song. The less common of the two songs is referred to as a soft song. The soft song is sung more during the dry season than the loud song. Each bat has their own variation of both songs, especially the soft song. While these songs were being observed, although each of them varied, all the songs had a similar pattern to them. It was clear which song was being sung. One theory to the heart-nosed bats singing and songs are linked to how territorial they are. Another theory is the singing corresponds to social interactions between each bat, which is why the songs themselves are unique to the individual.",

      "introduction":"\n\nSee text\n\nThe rock hyrax (/ˈhaɪ.ræks/; Procavia capensis), also called dassie, Cape hyrax, rock rabbit, and (from some interpretations of a word used in the King James Bible) coney, is a medium-sized terrestrial mammal native to Africa and the Middle East. Commonly referred to in South Africa as the dassie (IPA: [dasiː]; Afrikaans: klipdassie), it is one of the five living species of the order Hyracoidea, and the only one in the genus Procavia.\nRock hyraxes weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb) and have short ears.\n\nRock hyraxes are found at elevations up to 4,200 m (13,800 ft) above sea level in habitats with rock crevices, allowing them to escape from predators. They are the only extant terrestrial afrotherians in the Middle East.[note 1] Hyraxes typically live in groups of 10–80 animals, and forage as a group. They have been reported to use sentries to warn of the approach of predators.  Having incomplete thermoregulation, they are most active in the morning and evening, although their activity pattern varies substantially with season and climate.\n\nOver most of its range, the rock hyrax is not endangered, and in some areas is considered a minor pest.\n\nAlong with other hyrax species and the sirenians, this species is the most closely related to the elephant. An unrelated, convergently evolved mammal of similar habits and appearance is the rock cavy of Brazil.",

      "sections":"Rock hyraxes are squat and heavily built, with adults reaching a length of 50 cm (20 in) and weighing around 4 kg (8.8 lb), with a slight sexual dimorphism, males being about 10% heavier than females.  Their fur is thick and grey-brown, although this varies strongly between different environments, from dark brown in wetter habitats, to light gray in desert-living individuals. Hyrax size (as measured by skull length and humerus diameter) is correlated to precipitation, probably because of the effect on preferred hyrax forage.\n\nProminent in and apparently unique to hyraxes is the dorsal gland, which excretes an odour used for social communication and territorial marking. The gland is most clearly visible in dominant males.\n\nThe rock hyrax has a pointed head, short neck, and rounded ears. It has long, black whiskers on its muzzle. The rock hyrax has a prominent pair of long, pointed tusk-like upper incisors, which are reminiscent of the elephant, to which the hyrax is distantly related. The fore feet are plantigrade, and the hind feet are semi-digitigrade. The soles of the feet have large, soft pads that are kept moist with sweat-like secretions. In males, the testes are permanently abdominal, another anatomical feature that hyraxes share with elephants and sirenians.\n\nThermoregulation in rock hyraxes has been subject to much research, as their body temperature varies with a diurnal rhythm.  Animals kept in constant environmental conditions also display such variation, and this internal mechanism may be related to water balance regulation.\n\nThe rock hyrax occurs widely across sub-Saharan Africa in disjunct northern and southern populations; it is absent from the Congo Basin and Madagascar. The distribution encompasses southern Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and the Middle East, with populations in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Arabian Peninsula. The northern subspecies was introduced to Jebel Hafeet, which is on the border of Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe shade of their pelts varies individually and regionally. In particular, the dorsal patches (present in both sexes) of the central populations are very variable, ranging from yellow to black, or flecked. In outlying populations, these are more constant in colour, black in P. c. capensis, cream in P. c. welwitschii, and orange in P. c. ruficeps. A larger, longer-haired population is abundant in the moraines in the alpine zone of Mount Kenya.\n\nThe subspecies, which are sometimes elevated to full species, are:\n\nRock hyraxes build dwelling holes in any type of rock with suitable cavities, such as sedimentary rocks and soil.\nIn Mount Kenya, rock hyraxes live in colonies comprising an adult male, several adult females, and immatures. They are active during the day, and sometimes during moonlit nights. The dominant male defends and watches over the group. The male also marks his territory.\n\nIn Africa, hyraxes are preyed on by leopards, Egyptian cobras, puff adders, rock pythons, caracals, wild dogs, hawks, and owls. Verreaux's eagle in particular is a specialist hunter of hyraxes. In Israel, the rock hyrax is reportedly rarely preyed upon by terrestrial predators, as their system of sentries and reliable refuges provides considerable protection. Hyrax remains are almost absent from the droppings of wolves in the Judean Desert.\n\nHyraxes feed on a wide variety of plant species, including Lobelia and broad-leafed plants. They also have been reported to eat insects and grubs. They forage for food up to about 50 m from their refuge, usually feeding as a group and with one or more acting as sentries from a prominent lookout position. On the approach of danger, the sentries give an alarm call, and the animals quickly retreat to their refuge.\n\nThey are able to go for many days without water due to the moisture they obtain through their food, but quickly dehydrate under direct sunlight.  Despite their seemingly clumsy build, they are able to climb trees (although not as readily as Heterohyrax), and readily enter residential gardens to feed on the leaves of citrus and other trees.\n\nThe rock hyrax also makes a loud, grunting sound while moving its jaws as if chewing, and this behaviour may be a sign of aggression. Some authors have proposed that observation of this behavior by ancient Israelites gave rise to the misconception given in Leviticus 11:4–8 that the hyrax chews the cud, but the hyrax is not a ruminant.\n\nRock hyraxes give birth to two to four young after a gestation period of 6–7 months (long, for their size). The young are well developed at birth with fully opened eyes and complete pelage. Young can ingest solid food after two weeks and are weaned at 10 weeks. After 16 months, they become sexually mature, they reach adult size at 3 years, and they typically live about 10 years.  During seasonal changes, the weight of the male reproductive organs (testes, seminal vesicles) changes due to sexual activity. Between May and January in Cape Province, South Africa, the males are inactive sexually. From February onward, the weight of these organs increases dramatically and the males are able to copulate.\n\nHyraxes that live in more \"egalitarian\" groups, in which social associations are spread more evenly among group members, survive longer. In addition, hyraxes are the first nonhuman species in which structural balance was described. They follow \"the friend of my friend is my friend\" rule, and avoid unbalanced social configurations. The balance of social interactions within a group is positively correlated to individual longevity, meaning that \"it is not the number or strength of associations that an adult individual has (i.e. centrality) that is important, but the overall configuration of social relationships within the group.\" The reason for such a balanced group configuration, rather than one that is centrally dominated by a few individual hyraxes, was suggested to have to do with the fact that information flow to all members is important in a fragmented habitat as that of the hyrax, making a dominance hierarchy a liability for the survival of the group at large.\n\nCaptive rock hyraxes make more than 20 different noises and vocal signals. The most familiar one is a high trill, given in response to perceived danger. Rock hyrax calls can provide important biological information, such as size, age, social status, body weight, condition, and hormonal state of the caller, as determined by measuring their call length, patterns, complexity, and frequency. More recently, researchers have found rich syntactic structure and geographical variations in the calls of rock hyraxes, a first in the vocalization of mammalian taxa other than primates, cetaceans, and bats. Higher-ranked males tend to sing more often, and the energetic cost of singing is relatively low. A recent study found that snorts, a rare aspect of male hyrax songs, play an important signalling role as well, with increasing snort harshness being associated with \"the progression of inner excitement or aggression\". It is also positively associated with the singing animal's social status and testosterone levels. Singing has also been shown to be a marker of an individual hyrax's unique identity, where identity is expressed by unique vocal signatures \"that are not condition dependent and are stable over years in singers that did not alter their spatial position.\"\n\nThe rock hyrax spends roughly 95% of its time resting. During this time, it can often be seen basking in the sun, which sometimes involves \"heaping\", where several animals pile on top of each other. This is thought to be an element of its complex thermoregulation.\n\nMale hyraxes have been categorised into four classes: territorial, peripheral, early dispersers, and late dispersers. The territorial males are dominant. Peripheral males are more solitary and sometimes take over a group when the dominant male is missing. Early-dispersing males are juveniles that leave the birth site around 16 to 24 months of age. Late dispersers are also juvenile males, but they leave the birth site much later, around 30 or more months of age.\n\nThe species is known as klipdas in Afrikaans (etymology: rock + badger),[citation needed] while most people just call them \"dassies\" (the plural of dassie) or \"rock rabbits\" in South Africa. The Swahili names for them are pimbi, pelele, and wibari, though the latter two names are nowadays reserved for the tree hyraxes.\nThis species has many subspecies, many of which are also known as rock or Cape hyrax, although the former usually refers to African varieties.\n\nIn Arabic, the rock hyrax is called الوبر الصخري (Alwabr alsakhri) or طبسون (tabsoun). In Hebrew, the rock hyrax is called שפן סלע‎ (shafan sela), meaning rock shafan, where the meaning of shafan is obscure, but is colloquially used as a synonym for rabbit in modern Hebrew. According to Gerald Durrell, local people in Bafut, Cameroon, call the rock hyrax the n'eer.\n\nRock hyraxes produce large quantities of hyraceum, a sticky mass of dung and urine that has been employed as a South African folk remedy in the treatment of several medical disorders, including epilepsy and convulsions. Hyraceum is now being used by perfumers, who tincture it in alcohol to yield a natural animal musk.\n\nThe rock hyrax is classified as treif (not kosher; unclean) according to kashrut – Jewish food hygiene rules – due to statements in the Old Testament in Leviticus 11:5:\n\"And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you\". Hyraxes are also mentioned in Proverbs 30:26 as one of a number of remarkable animals for being small but exceedingly wise, in this case because \"the conies are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs\".\n\nIn Joy Adamson's books and the film Born Free, a rock hyrax called Pati-Pati was her companion for six years before Elsa and her siblings came along; Pati-Pati reportedly took the role of nanny and watched over them with great care.\n\nThe 2013 animated film Khumba features a number of rock hyraxes that sacrifice one of their own to a white Verreaux's eagle.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a small, leaf-nosed bat native to the Americas. It is one of three extant species of vampire bats, the other two being the hairy-legged and the white-winged vampire bats.\n\nThe common vampire bat practices hematophagy, mainly feeding on the blood of livestock. The bat usually approaches its prey at night while they are sleeping. It then uses its razor-sharp teeth to cut open the skin of its hosts and lap up their blood with its long tongue. The species is highly polygynous, and dominant adult males defend groups of females. It is one of the most social of bat species with a number of cooperative behaviors such as social grooming and food sharing. Because it feeds on livestock and is a carrier of rabies, the common vampire bat is considered a pest. Its conservation status is categorized as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because of \"its wide distribution, presumed large population tolerance of a degree of habitat modification, and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.\"",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The common vampire bat was first described as Phyllostoma rotundum by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1810. Another description was published in 1826 as a new species Desmodus rufus by Maximilian Wied, in the second volume of his work detailing his explorations in Brazil, erecting a new genus Desmodus.\nThe species received several scientific names before being given its current one—Desmodus rotundus—by Oldfield Thomas in 1901. It is classified under the subfamily Desmodontinae along with two other species: the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi). These three species compose the \"true\" vampire bats, as opposed to the \"false\" vampires of the family Megadermatidae and the spectral bat. All three species of Desmodontinae specialize in feeding on the blood of warm-blooded animals. However, the common vampire bat feeds on mammalian blood more than the other two species, which primarily feed on that of birds. The three species resemble each other, but the common vampire bat can be distinguished by its longer thumb. It is the only extant member of its genus, although other fossil species have been described. It has a haploid number of 14, for a karyotype of 28 chromosomes.\n\nA description published under the name Desmodus puntajudensi (Cuban vampire bat) by Woloszyn and Mayo in 1974 was later recognized as synonymous with this species.\n\nThe common vampire bat is short-haired, with silver-gray fur on its undersides, demarcated from the darker fur on its back. It has a deeply grooved lower lip, and a flat, leaf-shaped nose. A well-developed, clawed thumb on each wing is used to climb onto prey and to assist the animal in take-off. The bat averages about 9 cm (3.5 in) long with a wingspan of 18 cm (7 in). It commonly weighs about 25–40  grams (2 oz), but its weight can drastically increase after a single feeding.  The braincase is relatively large, but the snout is reduced to accommodate large incisors and canines. It has the fewest teeth among bats. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them razor-sharp. Its dental formula is 1.1.2.01.1.3.0, for a total of 18 teeth.\n\nWhile most other bats have almost completely lost the ability to maneuver on land, vampire bats are an exception. They can run using a unique, bounding gait in which the forelimbs are used instead of the hindlimbs to propel forward, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. This ability likely evolved independently within the bat lineage. Three pads under the thumb function like a sole. It is also capable of leaping in various directions, heights, and distances. When making a jump, the bat pushes up with its pectoral limbs. The hindlimbs keep the body over the pectoral limbs which are stabilized by the thumbs.\n\nCommon vampire bats have good eyesight. They are able to distinguish different optical patterns and may use vision for long-range orientation. These bats also have well-developed senses of smell and hearing: the cochlea is highly sensitive to low-frequency acoustics, and the nasal passages are relatively large. They emit echolocation signals orally, and thus fly with their mouths open for navigation. They can identify a metal strip 1 centimetre (0.39 in) wide at a distance of 50 centimetres (20 in), which is moderate compared to other bats.\n\nThe common vampire bat is found in parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America, as well as the Caribbean islands of Margarita and Trinidad. They can be found as far north as 280 kilometres (170 mi) south of the Mexico–United States border. Fossils of this species have been found in Florida and states bordering Mexico. The common vampire is the most common bat species in southeastern Brazil. The southern extent of its range is Uruguay, northern Argentina, and central Chile. In the West Indies, the bat is only found on Trinidad. It prefers warm and humid climates, and uses tropical and subtropical woodlands and open grasslands for foraging. Bats roost in trees, caves, abandoned buildings, old wells, and mines. Vampire bats will roost with about 45 other bat species, and tend to be the most dominant at roosting sites. They occupy the darkest and highest places in the roosts; when they leave, other bat species move in to take over these vacated spots.\n\nThe common vampire bat feeds primarily on mammalian blood, particularly that of livestock such as cattle and horses. Vampire bats feed on wild prey like the tapir, but seem to prefer domesticated animals, and favor horses over cattle when given the choice. Female animals, particularly those in estrus, are more often targeted than males. This could be because of the hormones.\n\nVampire bats hunt at night, using echolocation and olfaction to track down prey. They feed in a distance of 5 to 8 km (3.1 to 5.0 mi) from their roosts. When a bat selects a target, it lands on it, or jumps up onto it from the ground, usually targeting the rump, flank, or neck of its prey; heat sensors in the nose help it to detect blood vessels near the surface of the skin. It pierces the animal's skin with its teeth, biting away a small flap, and laps up the blood with its tongue, which has lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.\n\nThey are protective of their host and will fend off other bats while feeding. It is uncommon for two or more bats to feed on the same host, with the exception of mothers and their offspring.\n\nMale vampire bats guard roosting sites that attract females, but females often switch roosts. \n\nDuring estrus, a female releases one egg. Mating usually lasts three to four minutes; the male bat mounts the female from the posterior end, grasps her back with his teeth, holds down her folded wings, and inseminates her. Vampire bats are reproductively active year-round, although the number of conceptions and births peak in the rainy season. Females give birth to one offspring per pregnancy, following a gestation period of about seven months. The young are raised primarily by the females. Mothers leave their young to hunt, and call their young to feed upon returning. The young accompany their mothers to hunt at six months, but are not fully weaned until nine months. Female offspring usually remain in their natal groups into adulthood, unless their mothers die or move. The occasional movements of unrelated females between groups leads to the formation of multiple matrilines within groups. Male offspring tend to live in their natal groups until they are one to two years old, sometimes being forced out by the resident adult males.\n\nRegurgitated food sharing in common vampire bats has been studied in both the lab and field, and is predicted by kinship, association, and reciprocal help   In a field study conducted in Costa Rica from 1978 to 1983, vampire bats frequently switched between several roost trees and co-roosted with kin and non-kin. Mean genetic kinship within roosting groups was low (r = 0.03 − 0.11), but 95% of food sharing observed in the wild occurred between close kin (first cousins or higher). Most observed food sharing (70%) was mothers feeding their pups. The non-maternal sharing events were kin-biased suggesting that vampire bats prefer to help relatives. However, non-maternal food sharing is even better explained by frequency of interaction, even after controlling for kinship. Food sharing was only observed when the co-roosting association was greater than 60%. Food sharing appears to require social bonds that require development over long periods of time.  Among familiar bats, the amount of food given from bat A to bat B is best predicted by the amount of food given from bat B to A. Reciprocal sharing is most obvious over longer time spans as found in primate cooperation.\n\nVampire bats also participate in mutual grooming; two bats groom each other simultaneously to clean one another, and to strengthen social bonds. Bats that groom one another also share food. It was suggested that while grooming, a bat might assess the size of its partner's abdomen to determine if it really needs to eat.\n\nThe highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America. The danger is not so much to the human population, but rather to livestock. Joseph Lennox Pawan, a government bacteriologist in Trinidad, found the first infected vampire bat in March 1932. He soon proved various species of bat, including the common vampire bat, are capable of transmitting rabies for an extended period of time without artificial infection or external symptoms. Fruit bats of the genus Artibeus were later shown to demonstrate the same abilities. During this asymptomatic stage, the bats continue to behave normally and breed. At first, Pawan's finding that bats transmitted rabies to people and animals were thought fantastic and were ridiculed.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough most bats do not have rabies, those that do may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly, which makes them more likely to come into contact with humans. There is evidence that it is possible for the rabies virus to infect a host purely through airborne transmission, without direct physical contact of the victim with the bat. Although one should not have an unreasonable fear of bats, one should avoid handling them or having them in one's living space, as with any wild animal. Medical attention should be given to any person who awakens to discover a vampire bat in their sleeping quarters. It is possible that young children may not fully awaken due to the presence of a bat (or its bite).\n\nThe unique properties of the vampire bats' saliva have found some positive use in medicine. A genetically engineered drug called desmoteplase, which uses the anticoagulant properties of the saliva of Desmodus rotundus, has been shown to increase blood flow in stroke patients.",

It is endemic to peninsular Florida. Although rarely seen due to its secretive behavior, it can be found in large numbers in wet areas, with densities approaching 1,300 snakes per hectare (525 snakes per acre).",
      "sections":"The specific name, alleni, is in honor of American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen, who collected the type specimen.\n\nThe striped crayfish snake is of \"small medium\" size, 33–50 centimetres (13–20 in) in total length (including tail), with a heavy body. The stripes which contribute to its common name are indistinct and located on the dark dorsal side. The ventral side is yellow with some dark spots. The dorsal scales, which are arranged in 19 rows at midbody, are smooth on the body, with some keeled scales in the anal region. There is a clear sexual dimorphism with the females being the larger sex.

The snake has adapted well to the beds of water hyacinth that has taken over many waterways. Although the species is aquatic, it is rarely seen in moving water. The snake is primarily found in Florida. It is commonly found east of the central panhandle and in southeastern Georgia. The northern range limit is near the Florida-Georgia border.\n\nThe striped crayfish snake is active throughout the year except for the coldest months of winter. When active, it typically can be found among the roots of aquatic vegetation, and on land beneath logs or organic litter. It is active in still water during the day and probably at night. On cool days, it finds sunny areas on land to bask.\n\nThe striped crayfish snake feeds primarily on crayfish. It uses its coils to hold its prey while consuming it alive. Its teeth are small and very sharp, allowing it to grab and hold the hard outer covering of the crayfish. It typically swallows the crustacean tail first. Juveniles feed on insect larvae, most commonly the larvae of dragonflies and shrimp.\n\nThere is very little known about the reproduction of the striped crayfish snake. Adults probably mate during the spring season, and the young are born alive during the late summer or autumn. Brood size is from four to twelve neonates. Larger snakes usually produce more young than smaller snakes.\n\nNatural predators of L. alleni include great egrets, great blue herons, sandhill cranes, kingsnakes,  cottonmouth snakes, large salamanders and river otters. When attacked or disturbed, the striped crayfish snake escapes into the water. The snake releases a strong odor from its scent glands when captured. It does not bite, but may thrash around vigorously when captured.\n\nBecause the striped crayfish snake is dependent on a continuous and abundant supply of crayfish, any major changes to the crayfish supply, including destruction of the crayfish habitat, pollution and destruction of wetlands will be a threat to the survival of the striped crayfish snake.

T. versicolor is heavily concentrated in New England and the west coast in states like California and Washington. T. versicolor is considered a habitat generalist, and can thrive in many different environments. While they can be found in places like Grasslands, Wetlands, Forests, etc., they prefer dryer areas like normal trees and shrubs. Unlike other spiders in the genus Tetragnatha, T. versicolor will rarely reside near aquatic environments.

T. versicolor has been documented throughout Canada and very scarcely in Mexico, Central America, and even Cuba.\n\nT. versicolor is a habitat generalist, indicating it is a species that mainly responds to spatial cues and dispersal processes instead of environmental processes and cues from other individuals. Unlike its relatives T. viridis, T. straminea, and T. elongata, it can live in areas ranging widely in elevation and vegetation type. While they can be found in places like wetlands, spruce forests, red oak forests, grasslands, etc., T. versicolor are typically found further from water than other Tetragnatha. Trees and shrubs are the natural home for these spiders. If present in Marshy areas, T. versicolor will usually be near herbaceous vegetation.\n\nSpiders of the Tetragnathidae family feed mainly on small flying Insects that are caught in their wheel-shaped web. In addition to insects, they will also prey upon Arthropods that happen to get caught in their web. Known predators of the T. versicolor include Birds, Lizards, Shrews, Salamanders, and Jumping spiders. T. versicolor are nocturnal, and are active only at night so they can avoid predators. During the day, they will line their bodies on twigs so they can camouflage themselves. Usually, T. versicolor will use thin branches so that heavier predators have a harder time reaching them.\n\nInterestingly, venom composition of T. versicolor is related to the spider's diet. Female T. versicolor living in different regions consume different insects and this varied consumption of prey leads to differential expression of venom-producing genes. There is also differential expression between the two sexes, with males more likely to overexpress this venom-related gene than females – an example of sexual dimorphism in these spiders.\n\nAs an orb weaver spider, T. versicolor weaves orb webs. Orb webs are made up of three components: radial threads, frame threads, and the catching spiral. The radial threads converge to the hub, which is the central spot of the web. The frame threads act as insertion sites for the radial threads. Both the radial threads and frame threads act as a scaffolding for the entire web and are structural components. Neither the radial threads nor frame threads are adhesive. In contrast, the catching spiral is very sticky and elastic, as it is coated with gluey droplets. Stickiness of the catching spiral varies based on species depending on the volume of sticky droplets on the web. The number of radii also varies depending on species. Spiders of Tetragnatha will have fewer radii (about 18) than Mangora which have 50–60. Frame and radial threads provide strong and stable construction. This allows for good signal transmission through vibrations. The sticky sections of the web trap prey and absorb and impact/struggling vibrations from prey, thus preventing any damage from being done to the web. Even the radial and frame threads help absorb any shock when prey fly into the web. The hub section for T. versicolor is actually missing, so the whole web appears as if there is a hole in the center.\n\nThe spider web of T. versicolor, like any other orb weaver spider, is used to catch prey. It can be seen as an extension of the spider's senses. The orb web is efficiently made with a minimum amount of silk (0.1–0.5 mg of silk) in a short amount of time (30–60 minutes). The structure described above allows vibrations to be transmitted towards the center where the spider will usually sit, and provides direct access routes to anywhere on the web. In addition, the radii of the web take part in courtship by carrying chemical signals. The sticky section of the orb weaver's web is very elastic, and allows for trapped insects to struggle a great amount without escaping. These webs have an advantage due to their low visibility. Due to how thin the webs are, under natural conditions like low light or windy weather, they are practically invisible and can catch prey by surprise.\n\nConstruction of the orb web consists of three phases: establishment of the frame threads and radial threads, creation of the auxiliary spiral, and creation of the catching spiral. Interestingly, the creation of the web is done entirely without visual cues. T. versicolor will rely entirely on touch to create its web.\n\nEgg sacs of T. versicolor are laid in May, June, and July. Mating can occur many times throughout a single lifespan. The egg sacs are each around 5–6 mm in diameter and are of greenish/whitish color. Each egg sac may contain as many as 103 eggs, each around 0.66 mm in diameter. Mature spiders can be found from April to September. It is unclear how long T. versicolor can live, but it is speculated that they can live at least a year. Once spiderlings hatch, they will molt several times before reaching maturity.\n\nFor T. versicolor, courtship is very subtle or non-existent. Most spiders will readily mate with each other once placed within close proximity. Typically, males will approach the female and her web. The female will be oriented towards the male's point of contact towards the web. Sensing the male's presence through vibrations, the female can either chase the male away or proceed with mating. If the male isn't chased away, the male will continue to advance towards the female and mating will occur. The two will approach each other rapidly with their chelicerae held apart. Then, grappling with their cheliceral fangs will occur. Soon after, a ventral-to-ventral mating position will be taken. The male inserts his palp by using his third pair of legs to pull the female's abdomen closer. While the male inserts his left and right palps into the female's reproductive tracts, the hematodochae will rapidly inflate and deflate. Usually the male palps will be inserted multiple times. Sperm release then occurs.\n\nIn addition to the fact that most T. versicolor will mate with little to no signs of courtship, the likelihood that two spiders will mate is not influenced by female mating history. However, male behavior towards female spiders was significantly different depending on if the female was a virgin or not. Males turned out to spend more time in copula with virgin females. Time spent in copula with virgin females was nearly double time spent with non-virgin females. Total copulation time is not affected by other variables like male/female body size or age. In addition, length of each palp insertion and number of palp insertions was affected by female mating history. Virgins experienced fewer long palp insertions and fewer insertions overall. In contrast, sperm release is not affected by female mating history.\n\nT. versicolor is very sedentary in their hunting strategy. As an orb weaver spider, T. versicolor will stay in one place most of the time to catch their prey. They often sit in the center of their webs or wait on nearby twigs or branches for prey to get caught up in their web. A mature male T. versicolor a may also wander to catch prey, whereas a female almost always remains sedentary. The sexual dimorphic expression of the venom-producing genes explains this behavior – males are more likely to overexpress the venom gene than females, which would be useful given that males are more susceptible to predation and attacks if they wander to hunt for prey.\n\nT. versicolor has very poor vision, but is sensitive to vibrations and touch. During mating, T. versicolor will vibrate their webs to communicate.",

      "introduction":"\n\nCalliphora vicina is a member of the family Calliphoridae, which includes blow flies and bottle flies. These flies are important in the field of forensic entomology, being used to estimate the time of a person's death when a corpse is found and then examined. C. vicina is currently one of the most entomologically important fly species for this purpose because it arrives at and colonizes a body following death in consistent timeframes.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"Calliphora vicina was described by the French entomologist Jean-Baptiste Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin vicinus 'neighbouring'.\n\nCalliphora vicina is closely related to Calliphora vomitoria, another species important in forensics.\n\nCalliphora vicina is known as a blue bottle fly because of the metallic blue-gray coloration of its thorax and abdomen. It is distinguished from the commonly known C. vomitoria by its bright orange cheeks. The blue bottle fly is approximately 10–11 mm in length. The sclerites at the base of the coxa are yellow or orange. By chaetotaxy, the study of bristle arrangement, Calliphorids are characterized by having black bristles on the meron and two to three bristles on the notopleuron.\n\nThe similarities between the different species of Calliphora can make identification of immature stages nearly impossible. From the first instar to the pupa stage C. vicina is identical to that of C. vomitoria.\n\nCalliphora vicina goes through five generations in a year at a threshold temperature of 27˚ C (81˚ F).  A female C. vicina can lay up to 300 eggs, on fresh carrion or on open wounds. The larvae go through three instar stages. The first instar hatches in approximately 24 hours after the eggs are laid. It goes through its second instar in 20 hours and its third instar in 48 hours. Under favorable conditions, the larvae feed for about three to four days. When the larvae complete their development, they disperse to find an adequate place to pupate. The C. vicina pupa stage last about 11 days. At 27˚ C, C. vicina’s life cycle lasts approximately 18 days.\n\nClimatic factors, such as temperature, are known to influence egg-laying and development of instar-larvae. In warmer weather, the life cycle can be shorter, and in cooler temperatures the life cycle takes a little longer. Knowing the duration between the three instars and pupa stage and post-feeding larval dispersal can be useful to determine the post mortem interval in a criminal case.\n\nCalliphora vicina are found throughout the U.S. in urban areas and are most abundant in early spring and fall where the temperatures are around 55–75˚F (13–24˚C).  The species predominates in Europe and the New World, but has found its way into other countries via harbors and airports.  It was first recorded in South Africa in 1965 when a specimen was collected near Johannesburg, but specimen collections have been few and sporadic since then. It also occurs as an exotic in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of using blow flies in developing a post mortem interval estimate is the succession of insects that colonize the body. Based on the insects present at the time, a reasonable time frame for death may be established. C. vicina has its own part in the succession of the corpse.\n\nCalliphora vicina plays a major role in corpse colonization during the winter months, with less of a presence during the warmer months when temperature is less of a constraint. This fly has a lower threshold temperature for flight activity than other blow-flies, allowing for greater prevalence during colder periods. This period of activity must be considered when evaluating the presence or absence of this fly.\n\nWhen using the age of maggots to determine the PMI, the time before arrival is an important factor. The succession of C. vicina involves the arrival of adults two days after death. Therefore, two days must be added to the maximum age determined for flies found on the body.\n\nCalliphora vicina play an integral part in postmortem interval determination. Factors such as region, weather temperatures, time of day and conditions under which the body was found all contribute to determining a postmortem interval (PMI). To complete the calculation the entomologist must consider what is commonly known about C. vicina and integrate it with experimental data gathered from a crime scene. The entomologist must know how the blowfly behaves specifically in the area where the body was discovered. This involves recording environment temperatures at the crime scene as well as retrieving a history of the climate in the region. C. vicina in particular is adapted to cooler temperatures, appearing most commonly in winter and less often in the summer months. This puts their flight activity threshold at above 55–60 °F (13–16 °C), a lower temperature than most other blow-flies. Knowing the threshold temperature allows the entomologist to calculate accumulated degree days, which in turn helps determine PMI.\n\nSome knowledge regarding C. vicina behavior is well known. Case studies have shown that it is not the first species in arrival, although it does appear one to two days before Phaenicia sericata. Determining PMI is an intricate process because there is still much that we do not know about C. vicina behavior. For instance, it is a long-held belief that the species is not nocturnally active. However, it has recently been shown that C. vicina is indeed active at night under certain experimental conditions. Conditions of complete darkness do delay oviposition compared to well-lit conditions.\n\nAs Calliphora vicina continues to be researched, more information about the behavior will be gained to allow for a more complete picture of the lifecycle, thereby leading to better estimates of time of colonization.  New knowledge, such as the activity of C. vicina at night, will provide forensic entomologists with a better tool for their PMI estimation development.",

      "introduction":"\n\nHypnos subnigrum Duméril, 1852\nLophius monopterygius Shaw, 1795\n\nHypnos monopterygius, also known as the coffin ray or Australian numbfish, is a species of electric ray endemic to Australia, where it is common in inshore waters shallower than 80 m (260 ft). It is the sole member of its genus Hypnos, and family Hypnidae. This small species typically reaches 40 cm (16 in) in length. Greatly enlarged pectoral fins and an extremely short tail, coupled with diminutive dorsal and caudal fins all concentrated towards the rear, give the coffin ray a distinctive pear-like shape. It is a varying shade of brown in colour above, and has tiny eyes and a large, highly distensible mouth.\n\nThe sluggish and nocturnal coffin ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats, where it can bury itself during daytime. Able to produce a powerful electric shock reaching 200 volts for attack and defense, it can deliver a severe – albeit non-fatal – shock to a human. This species is a voracious predator that feeds mainly on benthic bony fishes, often tackling fish approaching or exceeding itself in size. On occasion, it may also consume invertebrates and even small penguins and rats. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and maternally produced histotroph (\"uterine milk\"). The female gives birth to 4–8 pups during summer. Not valued commercially, it is very hardy and can usually survive being captured and discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as its population does not seem threatened by human activity.",
      "kingdom":"Animalia",
      "sections":"The first scientific reference to the coffin ray was written by English zoologist and botanist George Shaw to accompany Frederick Polydore Nodder's illustrations of a beached fish, published in their 1795 work The Naturalist's Miscellany. Shaw interpreted the specimen as a goosefish, calling it the \"single-finned Lophius\" or Lophius monopterygius in Latin. Independently, French zoologist Auguste Duméril described a new electric ray in an 1852 volume of the journal Revue et Magasin de Zoologie, based on two specimens collected off New South Wales. He named it Hypnos subnigrum; the genus name is derived from ancient Greek ῠ̔́πνος (húpnos, \"sleep\"), for the ray's ability to induce numbness. Eventually, Gilbert Percy Whitley recognized that Nodder had illustrated the same species that Duméril had described, and thus the proper binomial name became Hypnos monopterygius. In 1902, Edgar Ravenswood Waite proposed Hypnarce as a replacement name for Hypnos, which he believed was preoccupied by the butterfly genus Hypna. However, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) does not seem to require the change, and thus Hypnarce is regarded as a junior synonym.\n\nThe common name \"coffin ray\" comes from the coffin-like shape of beached specimens, which become bloated after death. This species may also be referred to as crampfish, electric ray, numbfish, numbie, short-tail electric ray, or torpedo. Phylogenetic studies, based on morphology, have found that Hypnos is most closely related to the genus Torpedo. Hence, some taxonomists classify it with Torpedo in the family Torpedinidae (in its own subfamily, Hypninae). On the other hand, there are also taxonomists who believe Hypnos to be distinctive enough to merit its own separate family, Hypnidae.\n\nThe coffin ray has a wide but disjunct distribution in tropical and warm-temperate Australian waters. The western part of its range extends from Gulf St Vincent in South Australia to Broome in Western Australia, and the eastern part from Eden in New South Wales to Heron Island in Queensland. It does not occur off Victoria or Tasmania. This common, bottom-dwelling species is typically found close to shore, no deeper than 80 m (260 ft), though it has been recorded from as deep as 240 m (790 ft). In 1910, the trawler Endeavour caught several coffin rays at depths ranging from 47 to 120 fathoms (86–219 metres). The coffin ray favors habitats with sandy or muddy bottoms, including beaches, estuaries, and bays, and can also be found over seagrass as well as on and around rocky and coral reefs.\n\nThe unusual pear-like shape of the coffin ray distinguishes it from all other rays. Its body is flabby, with two large, kidney-shaped electric organs visible on both sides of the head. The pectoral fins form a greatly enlarged disc about as wide as long, that is thick at the center and thin at the margins. The leading margin of the disc is straight to gently concave. The eyes are minute and can be elevated on short stalks. Close behind the eyes and slightly larger are the spiracles, which are rimmed by small papillae in some individuals. The nostrils are located just ahead of the mouth, and are connected to it by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The capacious mouth forms a very long, wide arch; the slender jaws can be distended dramatically, though are not particularly protrusible. Adults have over 60 rows of small teeth in either jaw; each tooth has three long cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.\n\nThe pelvic fins are relatively large and merged with the pectoral fin disc at the front to form a roughly circular secondary disc. The two dorsal fins are shaped like rounded lobes and are located very close to the caudal fin, which is of similar size with a nearly symmetrical, rounded margin. The tail is extremely short, such as that the caudal fin barely extends past the pelvic fin disc. The skin is entirely devoid of dermal denticles, and may be creased in areas. The dorsal colouration ranges from dark to reddish brown, to grayish, pinkish, or yellowish, and may be plain or sparsely patterned with irregular darker and lighter markings. The underside is pale, as are the spiracle papillae. This species grows to a length of 70 cm (28 in), or possibly even 92 cm (36 in), though most are only around 40 cm (16 in) long.\n\nThe coffin ray is a slow and weak swimmer that moves forward with a jerky, fluttery motion. It is nocturnal and spends most of the day buried in sediment with only its spiracles showing. When disturbed, it has been observed performing a possible defense behavior, wherein it erupts from the bottom and swims in a loop with its mouth agape. This species is sometimes stranded on land by the ebbing tide, but can survive out of water for hours. Like in other electric rays, the coffin ray's electric organs are derived from muscle tissue and consist of numerous vertical columns, each formed from a stack of jelly-filled \"electric plates\" that essentially acts as a battery. It is capable of generating up to 200 volts of electricity and delivering 50 shocks over span of ten minutes, with each successive shock weakening. The coffin ray employs electricity both to subdue prey and deter predators.\n\nThe diet of the coffin ray consists mostly of benthic bony fishes, but also includes cephalopods and on occasion crustaceans and polychaete worms. Penguins and rats have also been recorded from the stomachs of this species. The coffin ray ambushes prey from the substrate, and swallows them whole head-first before re-burying. It often takes extremely large prey relative to its size; one observed individual 60 cm (24 in) long had swallowed a flathead (Platycephalus sp.) 70 cm (28 in) long, and the tail of the prey fish was still protruding from its mouth. Dead specimens have been recovered that had apparently choked trying to swallow too-large prey. The coffin ray is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph (\"uterine milk\") secreted by the mother. Females give birth to litters of 4–8 pups in summer; the newborns measure approximately 8–11 cm (3.1–4.3 in) long. Males and females both attain sexual maturity around 40–48 cm (16–19 in) long. This species is known to be parasitized by the tapeworms Acanthobothrium angelae and Lacistorhynchus dollfusi, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.\n\nThey are preyed upon by tiger sharks. One large tiger shark caught at Port Stephens in the early 20th century had more than thirty of them in its stomach.\n\nWhen approached, the coffin ray tends to keep still in its place of concealment on the sea floor. As a result, many divers, swimmers, and bathers have been shocked after accidentally contacting it. While not life-threatening, the shock can be quite severe; strong enough to numb a human limb for several minutes or knock a standing adult human off his feet. The shock can still be perceived by a person pouring a stream of seawater on the ray, or handling a net in which a coffin ray is held. The fish is capable of issuing multiple shocks in a short period of time, though each shock is weaker than the last.\n\nIn 1883, Edward Pierson Ramsay noted that it was the only ray native to Port Jackson that was inedible. The coffin ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawlers, but is hardy enough to usually be returned to the water alive. It is also caught in lobster traps and infrequently taken by spear fishers. As it remains common and widespread, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern. It has been kept in public aquariums, but requires moving food.",

      "introduction":"\n\nThe black-banded sea krait (Laticauda semifasciata), also known commonly as the Chinese sea snake or erabu, is a largely amphibious species of venomous marine reptile in the subfamily Laticaudinae, family Elapidae (cobras, mambas, coralsnakes and their kin). It is found in much of the western Pacific Ocean and some of the Sea of Japan. In Japan, it is known as erabu umi hebi (ja:エラブウミヘビ, 'erabu sea snake'); in Okinawa, it is known simply as irabu.\n\nThis sea krait frequents coral reef habitats, where it can explore tight spaces for prey, as it has a short head, thick trunk, and no easily discernible neck. The tail is simply extended skin, spread wide like a fin, and unsupported by any bony projections from the vertebral column. The stomach is comparatively wide. Massing together near the shore, it breeds between narrow cracks in the reef and in caves.  It is a nocturnal snake, rarely seen during the day.  It breathes air; so it breaks the surface at least once every six hours.\n\nToo slow to pursue prey in open water, black-banded sea kraits hunt primarily by exploring the small spaces within coral reefs, in an effort to find hidden fish or other appropriately-sized animals. This meticulous scouring of the narrow nooks and crannies within a reef is similar to the hunting behaviors of some of the sea krait's main prey choices, such as the moray eel. Additionally, the black-banded sea krait has been observed foraging in mutually beneficial 'alliances' with  bluefin trevally; the sea krait will scour the reef for potential prey as waiting groups of trevally watch, ready to pick-off any smaller, unwanted fish or crustaceans that are inadvertently flushed from the coral. The bite is highly venomous and paralyzes the prey. Females lay their eggs on land.",

Females lay 3–7 eggs that hatch after 4–5 months. L. semifasciata can reach a total length (including tail) of 170 cm (67 in).\n\nThe black-banded sea krait can be found in the warm waters of the western Pacific Ocean. However, researchers have recently found L. semifasciata in the waters surrounding southern South Korea. This area is located outside its \"typical distribution range (Japan, China including Taiwan, Philippines and Indonesia).\" The same researchers state that the black-banded sea krait has been dispersing northward from its typical distribution range due to climate change which has caused deterioration of its habitat.\n\nBlack-banded sea krait venom is reportedly ten times stronger than that of a cobra; however, as with the vast majority of venomous snake species, the black-banded sea krait generally does not aggressively strike at humans unless it is cornered or threatened (or otherwise maliciously provoked), preferring to conserve its energy and venom supplies for hunting purposes, reacting defensively only as a very last resort.\n\nDespite its potent venom, which is concentrated in the snake's venom glands (behind the eyes), the meat of the erabu snake is a winter staple food in southern Japan, where it is believed to replenish a female's womanhood or increase fertility. Irabu soup, or irabu-jiru (ja:イラブー汁), is said to taste like miso and a bit like tuna. This dish was a favorite of the royal court of the  Ryukyu Kingdom; it is thought to have analeptic properties.\n\nDuring certain warm years, the sea snakes are drawn en masse to the sea caves and tide pools of the coastal Ryukyu cliffs, in search of fresh water to drink and possibly to mate. It is in these cryptic spots where, by cover of darkness (and usually guided only by lantern light), elderly women—who are the most experienced at preparing irabu-jiru—explore the dangerous caverns in pursuit of black-banded sea kraits, which the ladies catch with their bare hands. Some areas may contain hundreds of the snakes, some engaged in active breeding balls, yet the women hike through the caves barefoot or with minimal protective gear. As with the handling of any venomous snake species, the sea snakes are grabbed quickly behind the head, as to avoid any potential envenomation. They are placed in a cloth bag, alive, and later quickly dispatched and prepared in a simple broth with kombu or other edible kelp, and possibly a bit of pork.",
