The raisin moth is known most commonly as a pest that feeds on dried fruits, such as the raisin and date.  It covers a range that includes much of the world, primarily situating itself in areas of California, Florida, the Eastern Mediterranean region, and some parts of Africa, Australia, and South America.  The moth prefers to live in a hot, arid climate with little moisture and plentiful harvest for its larvae to feed on.  Study of this species is important due to the vast amount of economic damage it causes yearly and worldwide to agriculture crops.\n\nAdult raisin moths have a life span of 11–16 days and devote most of their resources to reproduction. Eggs are laid on or near the fruit and larvae immediately begin boring and infesting the fruit. Fumigation after harvest does not save infested fruits, as the pest has already dug into the fruit and spoiled it.\n\nThe mating process consists of pheromone release by both the male and female moths as well as many other copulatory rituals that function to prevent interspecies mating.  Copulation consists of specific head bump technique paired with thrusting behavior. There is also a specific method of curling the abdomen that distinguishes this moth from the moths of other species.\n\nThis moth also displays migration behavior as well as nocturnal activity. During the start of cold winter months, the larvae of the raisin moth will move from the fruit in which they are enveloped to the top 4 inches of topsoil. It tends to be most active after 7pm, or around sundown, and then ceases activity by 5am, or before sunrise.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "The adults of this moth species are about 1\xa0cm long and have a brown grey complexion. Their wingspan ranges from 14–16\xa0mm. A key element of distinction are its hindwings, which have short fringes. Reproductive structures also serve as an element of differentiation. This moth has an almost straight uncus and a long thin costal outgrowth and at almost 90° angle. Wing pattern does not serve as a differentiating element in this species as it is very similar to other species of its genus. Their body has six rows of purple-colored dots running horizontally and their head is a reddish-brown color.\n\nEggs are small, round, and slightly yellow-orange and creamy white in color. They tend to turn to a more subtle greenish-grey color as they mature.\n\nThe raisin moth likely got its name due to being first identified on Muscat raisins in Fresno County, California in 1928. Its population quickly increased and spread throughout the world, now claiming ubiquity in the Eastern Mediterranean region, California, Florida, and some parts of Australia, South America, and Africa. Specifically, the moth is present in regions of optimal breeding temperature and food resources. Since its rise, it first spread to the tropics and later nudged its way into cooler areas by following humans on trade routes.\n\nAdult moths will not stay in a region that is below 15\xa0°C or above 36\xa0°C, which are the thresholds for their temperature tolerance. Adults will not fly at a temperature below 13\xa0°C. The raisin moth prefers a climate that has arid, hot, clear, and rainless summers, along with mild winters.\n\nThe raisin moth is a polyphagous insect, meaning that it feeds on a large variety of different fruits. The larvae in particular are herbivorous and prefer to feed on dry fruits on the ground or still on the plant. In particular they feed on fallen figs, ripe carob pods, grapes, cottonseed cake, cacao beans, prunes, peaches, apricots, pears, and more. In the springtime, they primarily feed on fallen mulberries because other host fruits are often scarce. However, they can be found year-round in decaying date fruit.\n\nDuring this stage of the moth's life cycle, the moth will mainly consume water.  They do not focus much on foraging and instead devote full resources to reproduction. This is possibly due to the very short duration of this stage.\n\nDevelopment of one generation lasts 43 days at an optimal temperature of 28\xa0°C.\n\nThe female raisin moth lays her fertilized eggs directly on or near the surface of the fruit of the host plant. The eggs are sticky, but are not glued down. They are laid one by one, or in small batches, and often in a star-shape. After oviposition, eggs hatch within 4 days, and approximately 75% of laid eggs will hatch successfully. Eggs are small, round, and slightly yellow-orange and creamy white in color. They tend to turn to a more subtle greenish-grey color as they mature.\n\nUpon hatching, neonatal larvae, or caterpillars, immediately begin digging into all parts of fruit. Larvae develop continuously throughout the year, living within fruits on the trees or rotting on the ground. Larval development depends on warmth, so development takes longer during winter periods. During cold winter periods, the larvae will stay in topsoil or under the loose bark of host plants and exhibit diapause, or a period of suspended development, until warmer temperatures arise.\n\nPupa is the term for the moth in its cocoon phase. Pupae are web-covered and brown. The cocoon is silken and they are usually hidden on the trees or in the upper soil layers near the vine trunks. Pupal development period usually lasts about 10 days, after which the adult moth emerges from the cocoon.\n\nMale and female moths live on average 11 and 16 days respectively. In the short period in which they are alive, adults lay 3–4 broods. The mean fertility of females is 160 eggs on the second and third nights after leaving the pupal stage and entering the adult stage. After laying her eggs, the female raisin moth does not stay to protect her eggs, instead abandoning them afterwards. The male raisin moth also plays no role in guarding or rearing its young.\n\nThe raisin moth has been observed to exhibit nocturnal flight patterns. It tends to be inactive during the day and begin significant activity at 7pm. Activity exponentially increases until it peaks at 8pm, when it then slowly levels off and reaches inactivity at 5am. Activity during this period consists of mating, as the moths do not forage in the adult phase.\n\nRaisin moth larvae face predation from competitors on dropped fruit. The mortality of the moth larvae in dropped fruit is higher in the presence of the fire ant Solenopsis aurea and the California harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex californicus. Both of these ants forage on dropped fruit, but will also consume the moth larvae if it is present.\n\nSeveral hymenopteran parasitoids such as Venturia canescens and Habrobracon hebetor harm raisin moth larvae. Specifically, Habrobracon hebetor stings and in effect parasitizes raisin moth larvae during warm winter days when they are located under tree bark. However, this parasitoid will not affect them during warmer seasons or on host plant fruit, so it is not effective as a natural pesticide. However, it can be used to effectively parasitize the larvae during storage.\n\nPheromones are chemical substances released into the environment which alter the behavior of other organisms in the same species. In terms of the raisin moth, the female begins the mating process by attracting male moths by releasing pheromones. These pheromones are quite similar to those from other moths in the Phycitinae subfamily, so elaborate courtship rituals are performed to avoid interspecies mating. Male moths also release a species specific pheromone that serves to reduce interspecies mating.\n\nA male raisin moth finds its way to the female moth by following the pheromone trail left by the female. As the male approaches he will first curl his abdomen such that it reaches over his head. Female will turn to face him depending on direction of approach. After the male curls his abdomen, his abdominal hair-pencils are exposed. After this, the female abdomen begins to rise and male and female join at a 30-40 degree angle from the ground. Mating is initiated by a process involving a head bump followed by a thrusting action. The thrusting is fairly accurate, with a 75% success rate on the first try, followed by nearly 100% success rate after the first successful attempt. Females exhibit a post-copulatory behavior that involves performance of a drag walk with the male moth. This consists of her dragging the male moth behind her for some time. These copulatory behaviors serve to avoid courtship by males of different species.\n\nThe raisin moth is classified as a pest throughout the world. It is especially known to cause severe qualitative and quantitative losses of dates. However, its larvae cause severe crop losses to almost all dried and drying fruits, as are specified in its diet. As the larvae feed on the insides of the fruit, it becomes filled with their excrement and fine powdery residue that is produced from the boring process. This leads to the fruit being filled with contaminants, which cannot be removed by post-harvest fumigation. Infestation can begin as soon as the fruit starts to ripen on the branches. In a study conducted in Iran, it was shown that initial infestation of the date fruit was only about 1.3%, but it peaked to 11.7% in mid-September, just months after initial fruit ripening in April. In the last month of the fruit cycle, in March, it was shown that up to 80% of the fruit was infected. More recent studies have shown that infection rates can be up to 90%.\n\nTo deter consumption of host plants, frequent application of chemical insecticides is often used. Mating disruption through the use of synthetic pheromone mimics is also an effective strategy and a greener alternative to pesticides. A specific pheromone, (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate, also known as TDA or ZETA, belongs to many species of pyralid moths and is a male attractant. Studies using this pheromone against the raisin moth showed that it greatly confused the male raisin moths and led to a reduction in larvae production. There is also some indication that blue neon light attracts raisin moths, which could potentially be used to deter the moth from laying eggs on fruit during mating season and lead to less larvae infestation in fruits.", 'score': 184.99815}, {'id': 'Pseudomys_bolami', 'name': ['Pseudomys bolami'], 'introduction': "\n\nBolam's mouse (Pseudomys bolami) is a species of nocturnal, burrowing rodent in the family Muridae that inhabits the semi arid and southern arid regions of Australia.

It is also quieter than a house mouse when handled and lacks a musty odour. Other distinguishing features include the absence of notched upper incisors which are characteristic of the house mouse. The weight of males and females is between 9 and 16 grams. The body length is 50–80 millimetres (2.0–3.1\xa0in) with a tail length of 71–103\xa0mm (2.8–4.1\xa0in). The fur is a dull grey-brown that blends from white at the base to much darker at the tips. It is very similar in appearance to the sandy inland mouse, Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, but with a longer hindfoot (18.4–20.1\xa0mm (0.72–0.79\xa0in)), 4–6 hairs per tail scale and longer ears (15.2–18.6\xa0mm (0.60–0.73\xa0in)).\n\nBolam\'s mouse was first described by Troughton in 1932 as a subspecies of the sandy inland mouse, as Pseudomys hermannsburgensis bolami. It was reclassified as a separate species by Kitchener et al. in 1984 based on nucleic acid electrophoretic and morphometric characters.\n\nIt has a wide distribution that ranges from south west Western Australia through South Australia to south western New South Wales. The range of the species has declined in recent times with the species no longer found in the Sunset region of South Australia and Victoria. Fossil evidence shows that its range has also contracted in New South Wales where it formerly occupied much of the west of the state including Mutawintji National Park in the north west. The range of Bolam\'s mouse is generally south of that of the sandy inland mouse with very little overlap in distribution.\n\nBolam\'s mouse is an omnivorous rodent that feeds on a mixture of seed, plant material, invertebrates and fungus. Due to the high variability of food resources available to P. bolami its diet is seasonally varied. Generally seeds particularly those of Maireana astrotricha occupy the majority of the diet when conditions are suitable for seed production. Plant material including leaves, floral material, stems and roots generally make up more than 30% of the diet. Invertebrates make up more than 10% of the diet and fungus makes up less than 1%.\n\nBolam\'s mouse has been recorded breeding in all seasons but typically breeds in spring and early summer to coincide with available food resources. It has also been observed to have an opportunistic breeding pattern that peaks with an elevenfold increase in numbers 12 months after a significant rainfall event to exploit additional food resources. Individuals are sexually mature when a body mass of 9 grams (0.32\xa0oz) is reached. Females can have 4–6 offspring. The estimated life span of Bolam\'s mouse is as low as two years.\n\nIt is found in a range of vegetation communities within the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. These communities range from Mallee-spinifex, Mallee-Shrubland, Belah woodland, mixed open shrubland/woodland, chenopod shrubland plains and Acacia/Eucalyptus woodlands.\n\nThey are found to inhabit areas that have loamy, clay, gravelly, sandy or calcareous soils where they are able to burrow. They also occupy vacant goanna, bettong and rabbit burrows and underneath fallen timber.\n\nThere has been a contraction in the geographical range of Bolam\'s mouse in recent times, with regional extinctions in areas where there is significant land clearing for agriculture such as the Eyre Peninsula and the sunset region of South Australia and north west Victoria. The clearing of vegetation particularly that of Maireana species removes not only a valuable food source but also microhabitats and cover from predators. Predation by introduced predators such as foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and cats (Felis catus) has also been observed throughout the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia resulting in a reduction in the numbers of many species including Bolam\'s mouse.\n\nIn New South Wales, Bolam\'s mouse is listed as endangered under Schedule 1 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and is extant in south-western New South Wales. In Victoria, the species is presumed extinct. Nationally, the conservation status of the species is listed as least concerned by the IUCN "in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, lack of major threats, and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category".', 'score': 179.9943}, {'id': 'Vespadelus_baverstocki', 'name': ['Vespadelus baverstocki'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe inland forest bat (Vespadelus baverstocki) is a vesper bat that occurs in central and arid regions in Australia.

This was later revised to place the group with genus Vespadelus. The type specimen was obtained at Yuinmery, an area in the Mid West of the continent, at an altitude of approximately 450 metres. The specimen, an adult male, was shot and collected by R. A. How in February 1980.\n\nAuthors have placed this with the 'pumilus group' of the genus, an uncertain alliance of the species Vespadelus pumilus and other taxa. A paper in 1994 recognised the population as species Vespadelus vulturnus, which it closely resembles, but this species concept was cited in a later arrangement in a paper  providing a diagnostic of female 'little brown bats' assigned to genus Vespadelus (Queale, 1997; et al). While outlining the means of determining females of the species in the field, Queale notes this population as part of a 'regulus complex' (a species complex) that encompasses the populations later recognised as Vespadelus vulturnus, V. regulus and this species, V. baverstocki.\n\nVernacular for the bat species include 'inland forest' and 'Baverstock's forest bat'.

The forearm is around three centimetres in length, slightly more than an inch. The colour of the fur at the back is a greyish-brown or a lighter fawn or sandy brown, this is variable or distinguishes two forms, the belly is respectively pale or white in these groups. Some individuals are darker beneath, giving them a uniform grey-brown colour. The face is pinkish and tragus sometimes white. The tragus is notably lighter than the rest of the ear. The penis of V. baverstocki is comparatively pendulous rather than bent at an angle, and the glans penis is funnel-shaped, not flattened, in profile.

The weight range is 3.6 to 7.0\xa0grams for a mean figure of 4.8\xa0grams.\n\nThe size of the colony is recorded as a few individuals or larger groups of sixty bats cohabiting in a hollow or building.\n\nVespadelus baverstocki is morphologically similar to several other species, Vespadelus finlaysoni, V. darlingtoni and V. vulturnus, and difficult to distinguish from Vespadelus regulus. The distinction in males may be determined by comparative morphology of the genitalia in captives, or the size and form of the baculum removed from that. The diagnosis of this 'little brown bat' in the field is a forearm less than 32\xa0mm and the fur a pale colour. The form of male genitalia will differentiate between other Vespadulus, females are more difficult to distinguish when observed in the hand. The first description notes the greatest length of the skull as a range of 11.6 to 12.5 millimetres, giving a mean length of 12.1 mm, a feature the authors report as moderately long. The measurements of the body, in that comparative study of species then assigned to Eptesicus, were also reported as moderate in length, a range of 36 to 44 mm resulting in a mean length of 40.0 mm; the wing measurements and tibia lengths were reported as relatively small.\n\nA widely distributed inland species, Vespadelus baverstocki is found at the arid centre of the eastern states of Australia and an isolated population in the midwest of Western Australia. The earlier records of the range indicate a contraction of a once continuous range. They occupy small cavities in rocky outcrops, leaving these to hunt and pursue insects.

The habitat type may be in a variety of woodlands or shrublands in desert and arid regions.\n\nThe inland range of Vespadelus baverstocki overlaps with a similar 'forest bat', the southern Vespadelus regulus, and females are especially difficult to distinguish; this species is generally smaller and lighter in colour. The distinction from similar females of the little forest bat Vespadelus vulturnus in a superficial examination is darker and slightly larger.

This specimen was later described as a distinct species by the Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori in 1900 with the binomial name Oestrelata feae, named after the Italian ornithologist Leonardo Fea and was later reclassified again as Pterodroma feae.\n\nThe gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma are seabirds of temperate and tropical oceans. Many are little-known and poorly studied, and their often similar appearance has meant that the taxonomy of the group has been rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the southern hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel P. mollis, but differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino\'s petrel on Madeira and Fea\'s petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003. More recently, some authorities have further split Fea\'s petrel, separating the Desertas Islands breeding birds from those in the Cape Verde archipelago.\n\nSangster estimated that the two Macaronesian species diverged at the end of the Early Pleistocene, 850,000 years ago, although the methodology used to establish this time scale has subsequently been questioned. An analysis of feather lice from Fea\'s petrels Pterodroma feae deserti from Bugio Island and Zino\'s petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated, since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. The species on Zino\'s petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda petrel, whereas Fea\'s petrel\'s lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific Pterodromas. This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the Desertas Islands.\n\nThis long-winged petrel is 33–36\xa0cm in length with an 86–94\xa0cm wingspan.

The males use mimicry of the poisonous pipevine swallowtail butterfly as a form of protection from predators.", 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'The range of C. promethea extends the length of the east coast of the United States and west to the Great Plains. C. promethea is found in deciduous forests.\n\nOnce the caterpillars hatch, they are fairly solitary. They eat leaves from the edge inwards. The caterpillars eat from several host plants. Caterpillars begin as yellow with black stripes, but become blue green over time. Once they are blue green, they develop four red and one yellow protuberances. These caterpillars go through several instars or skin shedding, and usually after the fifth shedding the caterpillar is ready to form a cocoon. When the caterpillars form cocoons, they are twice as long as they are wide.\n\nThe wingspan of this moth is 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102\xa0mm). Like most Lepidoptera, females are on average larger than males. Males are darkly pigmented, while females are more brightly colored. The males and females both have tan on the edges of their wings. The males have a set of eyespots on their forewings, but the females have spots on all their wings. In the northern part of the promethea silkmoth\'s range, there is one brood per year and it occurs during the early summer. In the southern part of the moth\'s range, there are two broods, with one occurring in the spring and the other occurring in late summer.\n\nFemale promethea silkmoths lay their eggs on the leaves of the host plants of the caterpillars. The eggs are laid at night. A female\'s eggs are laid in groups of 4 to 10 at a time. Eggs are white, flat and elliptical.\n\nSome caterpillars in the family Saturniidae will pupate in the ground. However, promethea silkmoth caterpillars pupate in trees. The caterpillars attach themselves directly to the branches of trees with their silk. Then, they curl a dead leaf around themselves. C. promethea pupates during the winter.\n\nThe location of the C. promethea cocoon typically provides the pupae with sufficient protection from possible predators. The cocoons hang from thin branches and are difficult to open, so mice may have difficulty predating because the branches are too thin to hold their weight and woodpeckers could have trouble opening the pupa. Other predators of the cocoons include some flies and wasps.\n\nCallosamia promethea utilizes Batesian mimicry, in which an edible species mimics a toxic species as a form of protection from predators. Promethea silkmoth females are rust and cream colored, but the males have very different coloration. Promethea silkmoth males mimic the pipe vine swallowtail (Battus philenor), a poisonous butterfly. The topside of the wings of promethea silkmoth males is black, as are the wings of the pipe vine swallowtails, which also have a shiny blue pattern on the top surface of their wings. The promethea silkmoth males do not have this reflective blue pattern, but their mimicry is still effective due to the fact that the blue reflective pattern is only visible on pipe vine swallowtails in a certain light, so the blue is not essential for C. promethea\'s mimicry to be effective.\n\nThe effectiveness of this mimicry was tested experimentally. Promethea silkmoth males were painted with various patterns, then released, and the amount of each group that was recaptured showed that mimicry helped the moths survive. The control group was painted black, to match their actual coloration. One experimental group was painted black and yellow to mimic the tiger swallowtail (Papilio glaucus), which is not a poisonous butterfly and does not mimic the poisonous pipe vine swallowtail. The other experimental group was painted with orange stripes to mimic the poisonous monarch butterfly. The two groups that were painted to be mimetic to a poisonous butterfly both were recaptured more than the group painted to match an edible butterfly. This shows that mimicry, specifically the partial mimic of promethea silkmoth males to pipe vine swallowtails, is adequate protection against predation.\n\nFemale promethea silkmoths release pheromones to attract males. The females remain in place, camouflaged, as they wait for the males to sense their pheromones and come to them. Females release their pheromones at a specific time of day called the "calling time". For C. promethea this time is late afternoon and into the early evening. When males sense the pheromones of a female they travel up the gradient of the pheromones and towards the female. Males are able locate females from miles away. One C. promethea male has been found to be able to detect and find a female from 23 miles away. A distance this long is likely to be covered in multiple days.\n\nIn terms of locating mates, males cannot find females unless they release pheromones, so the females control how frequently they mate. When females do send out their pheromones, the first male to reach a female will mate with her.\n\nCallosamia promethea are polyandrous, meaning the females mate with multiple males. However, not all females practice this behavior, some only mating with a single male. They are the only moth in the family Saturniidae known to be polyandrous. This is likely because C. promethea is the only moth that is both diurnal (males) and nocturnal (females). This allows for egg laying and mating to occur at different times of day, so there is no trade off between the two activities. Male moths are polygamous, as well. Polyandrous females are more fecund, due to laying more eggs. A female\'s eggs are mostly mature when they are laid.\n\nCallosamia promethea is not endangered and there are no specific management practices in place to maintain or control the species.\n\nWhile these moths do live on many species of trees as a caterpillar they are not reported to cause any noticeable damage to their host trees.', 'score': 170.50836}, {'id': 'Saccolaimus_flaviventris', 'name': ['Saccolaimus flaviventris'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat (Saccolaimus flaviventris), also known as the yellow-bellied sheathtail or yellow-bellied pouched bat, is a microbat species of the family Emballonuridae found extensively in Australia and less commonly in parts of Papua New Guinea.\n\nAlthough found throughout most parts of Australia, very little is known about its ecology due to the small size, nocturnal activity, and general elusiveness of most microbat species, making them difficult to study. They are sometimes mistaken for the endangered and less widely distributed bare-rumped sheathtail bat where the two species occur sympatrically, as well as other similar Emballonuridae species, but upon inspection are quite distinct and easily identified.\n\nAt present, the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat is the only member of the Microchiroptera that has been positively identified as a carrier of Australian bat lyssavirus.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'The first description of the species was provided by Wilhelm Peters in 1867, using a specimen that G. R. Waterhouse had proved to John Gould. The yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat belongs to the suborder Microchiroptera, or insectivorous microbats, and is the largest Australian member of the family Emballonuridae. The Emballonuridae are distinguished by a partially membrane-enclosed tail that projects into a sheath, hence the descriptive term sheathtail, and is represented by eight known Australian species. Within Australia, the family is divided into two genera: Taphozous and Saccolaimus, the latter of which the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat is one of only four known representatives worldwide.\n\nThe yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat is quite large with a mean body weight of 44 g that ranges from 28 to 60 g, and a mean head-body length of 81.8\xa0mm that ranges from 72.3-91.9\xa0mm. It has distinct fur colouration, with the dorsal back being a shiny jet black and the ventral underside a contrasting creamy white. Males of the species have a distinctive gular throat pouch that is believed to play a role in territorial marking. The throat pouch is absent in females, which instead have naked folds of skin around their throats. Unlike many other sheathtails, this species does not have a wing pouch in either sex.\n\nOther distinguishing features of the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat are a flattened head and sharply pointed muzzle, a mean forearm length of 74–77\xa0mm, and a mean outer canine width of 6.4\xa0mm.\n\nThe yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat appears to be wide-ranging, occurring across most parts of eastern and northern Australia, though in what densities remains uncertain due to the difficulties associated with capture and detection of the species. Much of the distribution understanding of this species has developed as a result of incidental sightings, such as one record from central western Queensland that was taken from a mummified bat found on a barbed-wire fence. Though most common throughout the tropical regions of their range, yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats are known to occur regularly in semi-arid environments including the Mallee region of north-western Victoria, Gundabooka National Park in northwestern New South Wales, and central-western Queensland. This species likely migrates into its southerly range during summer, with seasonal records placing bats in most parts of Victoria, southwestern New South Wales, and the adjacent regions of South Australia. \nThough less common, two specimens of yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats have been found in Papua New Guinea, one in the National Capital District and the other in Central Province.\n\nThis species occupies most wooded habitats, including both wet and dry sclerophyll forest, mallee and Acacia shrubland, desert, and open woodland. They are a hollow-roosting species,  so tend to be found in proximity of adequate old-growth trees.\n\nFew studies have been carried out to determine the specific roosting habits of this species. Yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats are a cavity-roosting species and are generally reliant on old-growth forest hollows. However, they have been known to opportunistically use abandoned animal burrows and human structures, and roost under dry clay and rock, though generally only solitary bats have been observed to do this.\n\nYellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats are mostly solitary, occasionally nesting in small, mixed-sex colonies of two to 10 individuals. A notable exception to this observation is the Brightview colony, found in southeast Queensland in 1996. The colony was discovered by accident during the felling of an old tree, and consisted of 29 individuals – the largest colony of yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats recorded.\n\nThough  no confirmatory studies have been carried out, yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats may be migratory based on local records that show the species occurring only at specific times of year. Though specific seasonal movements are unknown, observations have suggested migratory movements to the cooler southern Australian ranges during the summer. The possibility of seasonal migration is supported by studies of long, narrow wing shape in the species that appears suited to migration and the seasonal appearance of apparently exhausted bats in Victoria and South Australia.\n\nYellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats are canopy feeders, meaning that they are capable of fast flight, but inefficient at rapid maneuvering. They generally feed at heights of 20–25 m, unless feeding in open spaces or at forest edges, where they forage lower. Studies of stomach contents have found Orthoptera (grasshopper), Coleoptera (beetle), and Hemiptera (true bug) species, with beetles making up the bulk of the diet.\n\nBreeding receptivity in the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat begins in August when the right uterine horn increases in diameter, achieving maximum size in November. A single offspring is produced between December and March, with mammary glands regressing by the end of May.\n\nYellow-bellied sheath-tailed bats have a distinctive flight behaviour characterised by a fast, straight-line flight path with slow wing beats. This distinctive flight pattern combined with the light-coloured fur of the ventral underside make the species easy to identify in flight. The long, narrow wing shape and large body mass of the species allow for rapid flight with low maneuverability, making it best suited to canopy level and open-space flight.\n\nThe yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat is a nocturnal species that appears to be most active at least one hour after dark, but only maintains this activity briefly for a few hours. Many Emballonuridae species have been shown to conserve energy through prolonged states of torpor.\n\nLike all microbats, the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat communicates using echolocation, with only some sounds audible to the range of human hearing. Observational recordings have shown specific sequences of sounds to be associated with different behaviours, such as foraging, prey acquisition, and territoriality. This species has been observed engaging in intraspecific aerial displays of aggression.\n\nThough infrequently encountered, the conservation status of the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat is categorised as of least concern, because the species is both widespread and versatile in its habitat selection, thus is considered unlikely to decline rapidly. Conservation status at the state level is more cautious, most likely due to insufficient population data. In NSW, the species is listed as vulnerable under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, in South Australia as rare under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972, and in Victoria as threatened under the provisions of Part 3 of the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.\n\nThe main threats to conservation of the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat are habitat loss, particularly of old-growth trees, disturbance to roosting sites, and prey depletion or secondary poisoning as a result of pesticides and herbicides.', 'score': 168.47794}, {'id': 'Tomarus', 'name': ['Tomarus'], 'introduction': '\n\nsee text\n\nTomarus is a genus of scarab beetles in the subfamily Dynastinae, the rhinoceros beetles. They are native to the Americas, where they are distributed from the central United States to Argentina, and a few species occur in the Caribbean.\n\nThe adult beetles are nocturnal and attracted to lights; the larvae generally remain in the soil, often feeding on plant roots.\n\nIn order to identify species, the parameres of the male must be pulled out of the abdomen and examined. This process should be done carefully, because the parameres are quite fragile, "almost parchment-like".', 'sections': 'The following species belong to the genus Tomarus:\n\nData sources: i = ITIS, c = Catalogue of Life, g = GBIF, b = Bugguide.net', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'score': 167.18283}, {'id': 'Hylamorpha', 'name': ['Hylamorpha'], 'introduction': '\n\nSpecies synonymy\n\nGenus synonymy\n\nThe white worm beetle (Hylamorpha elegans) is a species of beetle in the family Scarabaeidae. It is the only species in the genus Hylamorpha. This beetle is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.\n\nThis beetle is recognized for its unique appearance and intriguing ecological role within its habitat as a decomposer.  Its glossy green exoskeleton, with variations in color across its head, pronotum, and elytra, makes it easily identifiable. It feeds on decaying organic matter, aiding in the breakdown of dead plant material. This process contributes to nutrient recycling and soil enrichment. This species is primarily nocturnal, so is often observed foraging for food at night.\n\nTheir mating behavior is influenced by host-plant volatiles, with males being attracted to females emitting specific pheromones while feeding on leaves. Once mating occurs, females lay eggs on preferred host plants, such as red clover.\n\nThese beetles are agricultural pests, causing damage to crops by feeding on grass and cereal roots in their larval stage. Additionally, they defoliate trees like Nothofagus species during adulthood, impacting forest ecosystems. Predators such as the black-faced ibis and rainbow trout contribute to controlling their population. Understanding their genetics, including chemoreception mechanisms mediated by odorant-binding proteins and chemoreceptors, provides insights into their behavior and potential management strategies. Their interactions with humans and livestock pose challenges in agriculture and forestry, driving the exploration of alternative pest management approaches like disrupting mating behavior or enhancing soil organic matter to reduce larval damage.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "The white worm beetle has a distinct appearance due to its long body, usually measuring between 11.8 to 18.2 millimetres (0.465 to 0.717\xa0in) long, and 5.8 to 10.8 millimetres (0.228 to 0.425\xa0in) wide across the shoulders. It showcases an oval physique and a smooth, glossy green exoskeleton. Its head, pronotum, and elytra (wing covers) can range from light to dark green, sometimes with shiny silver or bronze reflections, and rarely orange. Under certain conditions or after death, it can turn blue, red, orange, or purple.\n\nMales' front legs are usually green or light brown to match their body color. While females' front legs are mostly light brown, their back legs are green like their bodies. Male beetles have all green legs with a shiny appearance, especially on the middle and back legs, while females have green legs with varying degrees of shine. The ends of their front leg teeth are always black.\n\nThe beetle's head has small bumps or dots and is usually green or brown. Its antennae have ten sections, with one section longer in males than in females. The beetle's mandibles are triangular and end in a sharp or rounded point. Its back has tiny bumps or dots, and its sides have a small edge. The back legs and the lower body have long white hairs. The front legs have three small teeth at the end, and the back legs have a bump on the outer edge. The bottom part of the legs have small bumps, and the very last part of the body is slightly curved, both in males and females.\n\nSimilar to other scarab beetles, they likely rely on hygro and thermoreceptive sensilla to assess their surroundings. These sensory structures, such as sensilla coeloconica or sensilla styloconica, are known to respond to changes in humidity and temperature. This suggests that the beetle is adapted to habitats where these sensory cues play a significant role, favoring areas with specific moisture and temperature levels conducive to their emergence and activity.\n\nWhite worm adults typically emerge from the ground during the spring and summer, particularly when evenings are warmer.\n\nThe white worm beetle inhabits both sides of the Andes in central and southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. Its range notably corresponds to the distribution of Nothofagus species, which serve as its primary food source. It's an agricultural pest in Chile where the larvae feed on grain and the adults defoliate young trees.\n\nThe white worm beetle exhibits a broad diet encompassing various plant parts, making it a significant agricultural pest. In its larval stage, this beetle primarily feeds on the roots of grasses and small grain cereals, leading to severe agricultural damage in regions like Chile.\n\nAdditionally, during its adult stage, H. elegans occasionally causes significant defoliation on its secondary host plants, which predominantly include species of the genus Nothofagus, such as Nothofagus antarctica, betuloides, dombeyi, and obliqua. This feeding behavior can result in the death of young trees, particularly when there are large numbers of the white worm beetles on them.\n\nThis shift in dietary preference signifies a change in ecological niche and resource utilization as the beetle progresses through its life cycle.\n\nHylamorpha elegans larvae exhibit a selective feeding behavior, preferring particulate organic matter (POM) over fine organic matter particles for their nutritional requirements. This preference for POM suggests a specialized physiological adaptation to efficiently utilize certain types or qualities of organic matter present in the soil. The larvae's ability to selectively ingest POM indicates a sophisticated physiological mechanism for nutrient acquisition and energy metabolism.\n\nResearch indicates a strong correlation between larval growth and the quality of organic matter present in the soil rather than its quantity. Larvae feeding on soils rich in POM exhibit enhanced growth rates and increased live weight compared to those on soils with lower POM content, particularly evident in second instar larvae feeding on high POM soil. This underscores the importance of organic matter composition in facilitating optimal growth and development.\n\nThe physiological response of larvae to varying soil conditions is evident in their live weight dynamics over time. The study highlights that the magnitude of the effect of POM content on live weight varies at different sampling times, suggesting temporal variations in larval growth patterns in response to changes in soil quality. Furthermore, the growth rates of larvae feeding on soils with different POM contents exhibit significant differences, indicating distinct physiological responses to nutrient availability and organic matter composition.\n\nThird instar larvae feeding on soils with lower POM content exhibit diminished live weight compared to those on high POM soil, underscoring the influence of soil quality on larval development. The observed weight loss nearing pupation suggests a transition phase characterized by reduced feeding rates and metabolic adjustments, impacting larval growth dynamics.\n\nExploration of faecal production reveals physiological adjustments in nutrient utilization or metabolic processes during prolonged feeding periods, impacting faecal output in third instar larvae. While the POM content of soils does not significantly affect relative faecal weight per larva, the negative effect of feeding duration highlights the dynamic nature of larval physiology in response to changing environmental conditions.\n\nThe enemies of the Hylamorpha elegans beetle consist of avian predators such as the black-faced ibis (Theristicus melanopis). The black-faced ibis is known for its tactile, non-visual hunting strategy, utilizing its long and slender bill to probe the ground for prey such as H. elegans larvae and other terrestrial invertebrates.\n\nThe study found that larvae of H. elegans, commonly known as the southern green chafer, are among the important prey items consumed by the black-faced ibis. The green chafer larvae were found to provide a higher mean biomass and energetic content compared to other prey, making them a preferred food source for the ibis. H. elegans larvae are not immune to predation by the ibis.\n\nIn January, at Lago Traful in Argentina's Neuquén Province, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) prey on Hylamorpha elegans that inadvertently plummet into the lake from the overhanging Nothophagus trees. H. elegans is incredibly abundant along the shores of this lake and likely others.\n\nThe genetics of Hylamorpha elegans in the context of chemoreception is crucial for insect behavior such as host-seeking, mate finding, and aggregation. Chemoreception in insects involves specific proteins located in the antennae, particularly in hair-like sensory organs called sensilla. These proteins are responsible for recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the environment, and among them, odorant receptors (ORs) play a central role in transducing olfactory information toward the central nervous system of insects.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the genetic basis of chemoreception in coleopterans, including Hylamorpha elegans. While ORs have been the primary focus, attention has also been given to gustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs). A transcriptomic analysis of its antennal transcriptome revealed chemoreceptors ORs, GRs, and IRs. This analysis identified a total of 102 OR transcripts, 22 GR transcripts, and 14 IR transcripts for the species. The identification of these transcripts provides valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying chemoreception in H. elegans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis delineated five main clades corresponding to different sensory functions, including bitter, sugar, and carbon dioxide (CO2) reception. Transcript abundance analysis revealed HeleGR21a as the most abundant GR transcript, followed by HeleGR7, indicating their potential importance in chemosensory signaling.\n\nIonotropic receptors (IRs) play crucial roles in mediating olfactory and gustatory responses in insects. Transcriptomic analysis of H. elegans antennae identified 14 HeleIRs and 3 BpraIRs. These transcripts exhibited 3-4 transmembrane domains (TMDs) and were distributed across different clades associated with various sensory functions, including olfaction, hygrosensation, and thermosensation. Transcript abundance analysis revealed HeleIR8a, HeleIR25a, and HeleIR76b as the most abundant IR transcripts in H. elegans, highlighting their potential significance in chemosensory signaling pathways.\n\nOdorant receptors (ORs) are critical for detecting volatile compounds in the environment and are essential for various behaviors, including host-seeking and mating. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 65 OR transcripts plus Orco in H. elegans.\n\nThe presence of a larger number of GRs in H. elegans suggests a potential role in mediating feeding behaviors and host selection, consistent with the generalist feeding behavior observed in H. elegans. Furthermore, the identification of specific GRs associated with carbon dioxide detection implies their involvement in environmental sensing and possibly mate location.\n\nThe differential expression of ORs between male and female H. elegans suggests a potential role in sex-specific behaviors and reproductive strategies. Sex-biased expression analysis of selected ORs revealed differential expression patterns between male and female antennae, suggesting potential roles in mediating sex-specific behaviors or responses to environmental cues. HeleOR14, HeleOR64, and HeleOrco were significantly upregulated in female antennae, while HeleOR46 showed significant upregulation in male antennae. Similarly, BpraOR1 exhibited significant upregulation in female antennae, indicating potential differences in chemosensory responses between sexes. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of sex-specific behaviors and chemical communication in H. elegans and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying insect chemoreception.\n\nThe mating behavior of the white worm beetle is intricately linked to chemical communication facilitated by pheromones and sensory structures on their antennae. Virgin females release 1,4-hydroquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone, which are compounds that elicit attraction response from males. The ability of females to release these pheromones likely evolved as a mechanism to increase their reproductive success by attracting males for mating. On the other hand, males do not attract other males, indicating specific response to female cues. Olfaction plays a crucial role in scarab beetle mating behavior, aiding in the location of potential mates, food, and oviposition sites.\n\nMating behavior in H. elegans is notably influenced by host-plant volatiles, suggesting a mechanism by which adults locate potential mates. Male beetles exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize females while they are feeding on leaves, indicating the presence of sexual kairomones released by the attacked plants.\n\nAfter copulation, females of H. elegans engage in a distinct behavior of flying to specific crops, such as red clover (Trifolium pratense), to deposit their fertilized eggs. The seasonal flight period typically occurs from 11th November to 27th January. This oviposition behavior indicates a deliberate selection of oviposition sites, likely driven by volatile compounds emitted by preferred host plants.\n\nMales, equipped with a larger abundance of chemosensory sensilla on their antennae compared to females, demonstrate a heightened ability to detect pheromones, reflecting their active role in mate searching. Sensilla placodea, sensilla coeloconica, and sensilla basiconica are identified as the main sensory structures involved in chemoreception, particularly for detecting pheromones and plant volatiles.\n\nThis selective response to female odors suggests a form of sexual selection among males. Those individuals capable of detecting and responding to female pheromones may have a reproductive advantage by increasing their chances of encountering and mating with receptive females. Over time, this preference for specific chemical cues released by females may drive the evolution of male sensory mechanisms, enhancing their ability to locate mates in the environment.\n\nObservations suggest that mating encounters occur on foliage, where females remain feeding on host leaves, potentially enhancing male response towards the sex pheromone released by females. Compounds released from the host tree, such as those found in the essential oil of Nothofagus obliqua leaves, interact with female pheromones to increase male responsiveness. This behavior underscores the significance of plant volatiles in facilitating mating interactions.\n\nOne of the notable aspects of the white worm beetle is its reproductive behavior. During the mating season, males engage in elaborate courtship displays to attract females. Once mating occurs, females lay their eggs in moist soil or decaying vegetation, where the larvae hatch and develop.\n\nMale beetles exhibit pronounced dimorphism in flight behavior compared to females. Light trap data indicates that males are primarily involved in dispersal flights, as they are predominantly captured in traps. This suggests that males engage in active flight to search for mates. Females, on the other hand, are less frequently caught in light traps, indicating a more sedentary behavior that is likely associated with feeding on host leaves during the flight period.\n\nThe physiological aspects of Hylamorpha elegans, a native Chilean scarab beetle, are tied to its ecological interactions, particularly its olfactory perception and behavior. As a relevant agricultural pest, H. elegans exhibits cryptic habits, making conventional control methods challenging. Consequently, there's a pressing need for alternative, environmentally friendly strategies. Understanding the beetle's sensory mechanisms offers promising avenues for modifying its behavior. One key aspect of this is the study of odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which play a crucial role in the beetle's olfactory perception. These proteins, characterized by their structure and function, facilitate the recognition of odorants and their transport to olfactory receptors. Through the identification of OBPs and their interactions with volatile compounds released by its native host plant Nothofagus obliqua, researchers aim to uncover new semiochemicals that could potentially disrupt pest behavior.\n\nAmong the proteins involved in olfactory perception, OBPs stand out as crucial players. These small, soluble proteins are present in sensory organs and are characterized by their structure, which allows them to bind to odorant molecules. OBPs serve as carriers for lipophilic odorants, transporting them to olfactory receptors and initiating the olfactory process. Researchers aim to identify candidate compounds for pest control by leveraging the affinity of OBPs for specific odorants. By combining computational tools such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics, researchers can predict the interactions between OBPs and volatile compounds, providing insights into potential pest management strategies.\n\nThe focus on odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) sheds light on the beetle's olfactory perception mechanisms. Despite the prediction of six OBPs from the genome draft, only four were successfully amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cDNA extracted from adult individuals. Notably, these transcripts exhibited higher abundance in chemosensitive tissues compared to hindleg tibia, indicating their crucial role in olfactory processes. The characterized OBPs, namely HeleOBP1, HeleOBP3, HeleOBP4, and HeleOBP6, vary in length, isoelectric point (pI), and molecular mass, reflecting their diverse functions in odorant detection and discrimination.\n\nThe identification of four novel odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) in H. elegans represents a crucial advancement, particularly considering the limited genomic information available for scarab beetle species. RT-PCR analyses revealed that these OBPs are predominantly expressed in organs associated with olfactory and gustatory senses, indicating their pivotal role in chemosensation. Notably, HeleOBP1 and HeleOBP3 exhibit heightened expression levels in the antenna, suggesting their involvement in detecting semiochemicals relevant to host-seeking and oviposition behaviors. Conversely, HeleOBP4 and HeleOBP6 show increased expression in mouthparts, potentially implicating them in the perception of feeding-related cues. These tissue-specific expression patterns provide valuable insights into the functional roles of OBPs in mediating insect behaviors related to mating, feeding, and oviposition.\n\nThe discovery of novel volatile compounds from Nothofagus obliqua leaves further enriches our understanding of H. elegans physiology. Six compounds, including beta-myrcene, beta-ocimene, dodecane, tetradecane, alpha-gurjunene, and aromadendrene, were identified, expanding the repertoire of chemicals relevant to the beetle's olfactory perception and behavior. These compounds hold promise for future analysis aimed at elucidating their roles as attractants, repellents, or pheromones in H. elegans ecology and communication.\n\nIn the context of H. elegans, understanding the physiological basis of olfactory perception is essential for developing effective pest management techniques. By mining the beetle's genome and characterizing novel OBPs, researchers can uncover key insights into its sensory mechanisms. Furthermore, by elucidating the interactions between OBPs and volatile compounds released by its preferred host plant, researchers can identify potential disruptors of pest behavior.\n\nChemoreception, crucial for insect behavior such as host-seeking and mate finding, relies on specific proteins located in the Hylamorpha elegans’ antennae, particularly in sensilla, which are hair-like sensory organs. These proteins, including odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), and ionotropic receptors (IRs), play essential roles in detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the environment.\n\nOlfaction is implicated in foraging, host selection, mate finding, aggregation, and reproductive behaviors in numerous insect species. The comparative analysis of chemoreceptors, including gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and odorant receptors (ORs), sheds light on the molecular basis of olfactory perception in H. elegans. Notably, H. elegans has a larger number of identified GRs compared to Brachysternus prasinus, another South American scarab beetle that lives in similar areas as H. elegans. This larger number of identified GRs in H. elegans suggests a broader repertoire for detecting sugars from various tree species, potentially influencing feeding behavior, host selection, and defense mechanisms.\n\nIn the peripheral olfactory system, sensilla houses these chemoreceptors, which are responsible for recognizing and transducing olfactory information toward the central nervous system. Among these receptors, ORs are central to mediating various behavioral responses, such as attraction or repulsion, by transducing olfactory signals.\n\nGustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs) also contribute to chemoreception in insects. GRs are involved in recognizing a wide range of tastants, including bitter and sweet molecules, sugars, nutrients, and carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, IRs play diverse roles depending on the insect species, including thermal and water sensations, as well as avoidance behaviors, such as selecting oviposition sites.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of ionotropic receptors (IRs) reveals a diverse array of receptors in H. elegans, distributed across clades associated with gustation, olfaction, hygrosensation, and thermosensation. The presence of coreceptors such as HeleIR8a and HeleIR25a shows their importance in mediating chemosensory responses, with implications for environmental sensing and behavioral adaptations.\n\nSex-biased expression analysis of selected ORs provided insights into potential differences in olfactory sensitivity between male and female H. elegans. Significant expression differences were observed for certain ORs, indicating a role in mediating sex-specific behaviors or responses to environmental cues. The differential expression of ORs between male and female H. elegans suggests a role in sex-specific behaviors, including mate location and reproductive strategies.\n\nThe beetle poses significant challenges for both humans and livestock in Central and Southern Chile and Southwestern Argentina. The larvae of these beetles inflict severe agricultural damage by feeding on the roots of grasses and small grain cereals in Chile. The beetle is also a significant pest in berry crops and common hazel orchards, reducing crop yields and forage availability. Livestock grazing on pastures infested with these larvae may also experience indirect effects. Damage to pasture plants' roots can lead to reduced forage availability and quality, affecting livestock nutrition and productivity. Additionally, irregular outbreaks of H. elegans larvae in grasses and small grain cereals can be challenging for farmers and ranchers in maintaining viable pasturelands and cereal crops.\n\nAdditionally, their adult counterparts occasionally cause extensive defoliation on secondary host plants, particularly species of Nothofagus trees such as Nothofagus antarctica, betuloides, dombeyi, and obliqua. These adult beetles often congregate, feed, and mate in the canopy of these trees. This defoliation can result in the death of young trees.\n\nThe use of semiochemicals, such as pheromones and kairomones, for pest management has been poorly developed, adding to the challenge of mitigating their impact. Alternative strategies based on ethology, such as disrupting mating or host finding, are being explored as options for pest management. Studies have also shown that adding manure to soil, which increases the availability of labile organic matter such as particulate organic matter (POM), can reduce larval damage to pasture plants. The presence of POM may serve as an alternative food source for scarab larvae, potentially decreasing their intensity of feeding on plant roots.", 'score': 166.8479}, {'id': 'Lampronycteris', 'name': ['Lampronycteris'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe yellow-throated big-eared bat or orange-throated bat(Lampronycteris brachyotis) is a species of bat that ranges from southern Mexico to Brazil.

It can be found in countries with Mediterranean climates, such as Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Israel, Malta, southern Bulgaria, North Macedonia, coastal Croatia (except western Istria), Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Adriatic islands, coastal Montenegro, the coastal part of Albania, Cyprus, Turkey, northern Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia,  Jordan, Syria, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, northern Yemen (the Socotra Archipelago), Somalia, Eritrea, Kenya, southern Iran, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, the Balearic Islands (Island Addaya Grande), the Canary Islands (introduced to Gran Canaria and Tenerife), Panama, Puerto Rico, Belize, and Cuba.\n\nAs of 2016, it was known from scattered records in the Southwestern United States, including Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico and more extensively in the Southern United States, including  Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, being particularly well-established in Gulf Coast states in the east. More recently records have been published from several localities in Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. It was also reported from Indiana in 2019  but, it was unknown at that time if the individual represented an established population or not.\n\nIn Mexico, introductions are known to the states Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Sonora, Durango, and Nuevo León.\n\nMediterranean house geckos inhabit a wide range of habitats, in areas near human presence such as university campuses, cemeteries, coastal regions, and shrublands. In these urban or suburban areas, they are typically seen in the cracks of old brick buildings. They can also be found in other areas such as mountain cliffs and caves. Their nests can be found in trash piles, attics, or under the baseboards of buildings.\n\nMediterranean house geckos are nocturnal.  They emit a distinctive, high-pitched call somewhat like a squeak or the chirp of a bird, possibly expressing a territorial message. Because of this aggressive behavior, juveniles avoid most interaction with adult geckos.\nThey are voracious predators of moths and small roaches, and are attracted to outdoor lights in search of these prey. They are also attracted by the call of a male decorated cricket (Gryllodes supplicans); although the males are usually safely out of reach in a burrow, female crickets attracted to the male\'s call can be intercepted and eaten.\n\nMediterranean house geckos reach sexual maturity within four months to a year. Male house geckos produce clicking sounds to attract a mate, with the females responding in their own squeaks. They also display copulatory biting, with stronger bites resulting in higher fertilization success. Fertilization is internal. The breeding season is typically from April to August each year and eggs are laid mid-May to August in an average clutch size of two. Female house geckos experience delayed fertilization and can store sperm in a funnel-shaped organ called the infundibulum for up to five months. Because of this, exact gestation time is unknown, but is estimated to be around 40-60 days. Neither males nor females have been observed providing any parental care, with males going as far as to bite the juveniles.\n\nPrimary prey of Mediterranean house geckos has been noted to include crickets, grasshoppers, cockroaches, spiders, beetles, moths, butterflies, ants, isopods, and snails. These geckos are visual hunters; prey selection depends on whether it is alive or dead.

Depending on the activity, coloration can differ.", 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'The specific name, cepediana, is in honor of French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède.\n\nP. cepediana is a mid-sized day gecko. It can reach a total length (including tail) of 3.75–5.5 in (9.5–14 cm). The female blue-tailed gecko is usually smaller in size than the male.\n\nThe male blue-tailed geckos is typically more vivid than the female. The male body colour is light green or bluish green. The back of the male has a bright blue colour and is covered with dark red spots and dashes. The male has a deep blue tail; this blue color may also be found on the face. The female lacks the brilliant blue colour of the male. The female has a bright green back and rust-coloured spots. There is always a dorso-lateral stripe present, which may be broken. A red stripe extends from the nostril to the shoulder.\n\nThe blue-tailed gecko and other reptiles are sensitive to artificial light at night and will change their behaviors as a result of being exposed to this light. The blue-tailed gecko is primarily diurnal, as are most of the geckos in its genus (Phelsuma). It has been found that the blue-tailed gecko will change its foraging behavior from diurnal to nocturnal in situations in which it has artificial light sources at its disposal. Nocturnal activity includes agonistic or aggressive behaviors, courtship, and foraging. When artificial lights are used in nocturnal situations, it alters the amount of time and effort that visual predators will spend foraging.\n\nP. cepediana is one of only seven species of the Mascarene species that is still extant. This species is the sole pollinator and seed disperser of a climbing shrub, Roussea simplex, which is endemic to the mountains of Mauritius.  P. cepediana can typically be found on trees and bushes that produce fruits, such as coconut palms, banana trees, and papayas. These locations are warm and moist climates, which are preferred by this gecko.[citation needed]\n\nThe blue-tailed day gecko inhabits the island Mauritius where it is widely distributed. P. cepediana may also have been introduced to Madagascar where it has been reported a few times, amongst others in the region of Iviloina. These observations have not been confirmed, however. Although P. cepediana seems to be unable to colonize agricultural areas, it can survive in suburban gardens that are heavily watered and planted as long as these gardens are near trees that produce fruit or flowers throughout the year. \n\nThe blue-tailed day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also licks soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar. The flowers of the now critically endangered liana Roussea simplex produce copious amounts of nectar and are pollinated only by the blue-tailed day gecko. The blue-tailed day gecko plays a role by licking up a gelatinous substance secreted by the fruit which contains the minute seeds. It disperses the seeds in its droppings.\n\nP. cepediana can be quite aggressive toward both its own and to other Phelsuma species. In captivity, where the female cannot escape, the male sometimes seriously wounds the female. In this case, the male and female must be separated.[citation needed]\n\nLizards can change in color and pattern ontogenetically. Conspicuous tail colors appear only in juveniles and can fade by adulthood. Research has been conducted in order to determine if these tail colors compensate for "an increased activity, level, deflecting imminent attacks to the tail." Research has suggested that alteration of activities can affect the ontogenetic color and pattern changes. Lizards that are active and forage in habitats that are open tend to increase the probability that they will be attacked by ambush predators. Deflection displays and conspicuous colors can shift attacks to the expendable tail. By doing this, the prey\'s overall likelihood of surviving the attack is increased.\n\nThe adult female blue-tailed gecko lays eggs every 3–4 weeks. It typically lays two eggs in a clutch. \n\nThe female will lay its eggs in a location that it feels is safe and protected. It will glue its eggs in order to increase safety. When they are kept at a temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, the eggs take between 40 and 45 days to hatch. When the newborns are measured, they are normally around 40 mm (1.6 inches).[citation needed]\n\nThe blue-tailed gecko frequently will hide amongst dense patches of palm-like Pandanus plants in order to protect itself from its enemies. P. cepediana is preyed upon by the critically endangered Mauritius kestrel. This bird feeds almost exclusively on Phelsuma geckos, making P. cepediana one of its main prey items. Other birds that are endemic to Mauritius also feed on Phelsuma geckos. \n\nThe 2mm-long ant Technomyrmex albipes that was introduced to Mauritius from the Indo-Pacific area seals the flowers of Roussea with clay to protect mealy bugs. The mealy bugs drink the sap and excrete a sugary urine that is collected by the ants. The ants attack animals that visit the plant, preventing the blue-tailed day gecko from pollinating the flowers and eating from the fruit, and in this way seriously hampering Roussea\'s reproduction.\n\nMale P. cepediana are extremely high in demand as pets due to their vibrant coloration, and can cost $100 to $200 each.

A member of this family is also called a felid (/ˈfiːlɪd/).\n\nThe 41 extant Felidae species exhibit the greatest diversity in fur patterns of all terrestrial carnivores. Cats have retractile claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest and savanna habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.\n\nReginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: the Pantherinae, the Felinae and the Acinonychinae, differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths which protect their claws.\nThis concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and techniques for the analysis of morphological data. Today, the living Felidae are divided into two subfamilies: the Pantherinae and Felinae, with the Acinonychinae subsumed into the latter. Pantherinae includes five Panthera and two Neofelis species, while Felinae includes the other 34 species in 12 genera.\n\nThe first cats emerged during the Oligocene about 25 million years ago, with the appearance of Proailurus and Pseudaelurus. The latter species complex was ancestral to two main lines of felids: the cats in the extant subfamilies and a group of extinct "saber-tooth" felids of the subfamily Machairodontinae, which range from the type genus Machairodus of the late Miocene to Smilodon of the Pleistocene. The "false saber-toothed cats", the Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae, are not true cats but are closely related. Together with the Felidae, Viverridae, hyenas and mongooses, they constitute the Feliformia.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "All members of the cat family have the following characteristics in common:\n\nThe colour, length and density of their fur are very diverse. Fur colour covers the gamut from white to black, and fur patterns from distinctive small spots, and stripes to small blotches and rosettes. Most cat species are born with spotted fur, except the jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi), Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) and caracal (Caracal caracal). The spotted fur of lion (Panthera leo), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and cougar (Puma concolor) cubs change to uniform fur during their ontogeny. Those living in cold environments have thick fur with long hair, like the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and the Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul). Those living in tropical and hot climate zones have short fur. Several species exhibit melanism with all-black individuals, cougars are notable for lacking melanism but leucism and albinism are present in cougars along with many other felids.\n\nIn the great majority of cat species, the tail is between a third and a half of the body length, although with some exceptions, like the Lynx species and margay (Leopardus wiedii). Cat species vary greatly in body and skull sizes, and weights:\n\nMost cat species have a haploid number of 18 or 19. Central and South American cats have a haploid number of 18, possibly due to the combination of two smaller chromosomes into a larger one.\n\nFelidae have type IIx muscle fibers three times more powerful than the muscle fibers of human athletes.\n\n(A) Homotherium latidens (Owen, 1846), specimen DMF AS RS, no.

Proailurus is the oldest known cat that occurred after the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about 33.9\xa0million years ago; fossil remains were excavated in France and Mongolia's Hsanda Gol Formation. Fossil occurrences indicate that the Felidae arrived in North America around 18.5\xa0million years ago. This is about 20\xa0million years later than the Ursidae and the Nimravidae, and about 10\xa0million years later than the Canidae.\n\nIn the Early Miocene about 20\xa0to\xa016.6 million years ago, Pseudaelurus lived in Africa. Its fossil jaws were also excavated in geological formations of Europe's Vallesian, Asia's Middle Miocene and North America's late Hemingfordian to late Barstovian epochs.\n\nIn the Early or Middle Miocene, the saber-toothed Machairodontinae evolved in Africa and migrated northwards in the Late Miocene. With their large upper canines, they were adapted to prey on large-bodied megaherbivores. Miomachairodus is the oldest known member of this subfamily. Metailurus lived in Africa and Eurasia about 8\xa0to\xa06 million years ago. Several Paramachaerodus skeletons were found in Spain. Homotherium appeared in Africa, Eurasia and North America around 3.5\xa0million years ago, and Megantereon about 3\xa0million years ago. Smilodon lived in North and South America from about 2.5\xa0million years ago. This subfamily became extinct in the Late Pleistocene.\n\nResults of mitochondrial analysis indicate that the living Felidae species descended from a common ancestor, which originated in Asia in the Late Miocene epoch. They migrated to Africa, Europe and the Americas in the course of at least 10 migration waves during the past ~11\xa0million years. Low sea levels and interglacial and glacial periods facilitated these migrations. Panthera blytheae is the oldest known pantherine cat dated to the late Messinian to early Zanclean ages about 5.95\xa0to\xa04.1 million years ago. A fossil skull was excavated in 2010 in Zanda County on the Tibetan Plateau. Panthera palaeosinensis from North China probably dates to the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene. The skull of the holotype is similar to that of a lion or leopard. Panthera zdanskyi dates to the Gelasian about 2.55\xa0to\xa02.16 million years ago. Several fossil skulls and jawbones were excavated in northwestern China. Panthera gombaszoegensis is the earliest known pantherine cat that lived in Europe about 1.95\xa0to\xa01.77 million years ago.\n\nLiving felids fall into eight evolutionary lineages or species clades. Genotyping of the nuclear DNA of all 41 felid species revealed that hybridization between species occurred in the course of evolution within the majority of the eight lineages.\n\nModelling of felid coat pattern transformations revealed that nearly all patterns evolved from small spots.\n\nTraditionally, five subfamilies had been distinguished within the Felidae based on phenotypical features: the Pantherinae, the Felinae, the Acinonychinae, and the extinct Machairodontinae and Proailurinae.

It once was found across other islands, such as Cebu, Guimaras, Leyte, Masbate, and Samar. It is one of three endemic deer species found in the Philippines, although it was not recognized as a separate species until 1983. An estimated 2,500 mature individuals survived worldwide in 1996, according to the IUCN; today’s surviving wild number is uncertain. The diet of the deer, which consists of a variety of different types of grasses, leaves, and buds within the forest, is the primary indicator of its habitat. Since 1991, the range of the species has severely decreased and is now almost co-extensive with that of the Visayan warty pig.\n\nIn April 2009, an expedition team of British and Filipino mountaineers and scientists discovered evidence of two separate groups of deer in the North Negros Natural Park. These signs (scat and feeding sites) were believed to be the first scientific evidence of the deer's activity for over 25 years. It is estimated that 300 animals survive on the island of Negros. Conservation efforts are currently underway, with the intention of preserving the remaining population, but have been poorly funded and supported.\n\nIn 2012, the Negros Interior Biodiversity Expedition used camera traps in the centre of the North Negros Natural Park to take the first photos of the species in the wild.", 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'The Visayan deer is small and short-legged, but it is the largest endemic species of deer among the Philippine islands. Adults range from 125 to 130\xa0cm (49 to 51\xa0in) long from the head to the base of the tail, 70 to 80\xa0cm (28 to 31\xa0in) in shoulder height and 40 to 60\xa0kg (88 to 132\xa0lb) in weight. This species is easily distinguished from other species of deer in the Philippines by the distinctive "A"-pattern of beige spots on its deep brown back and sides. Other distinctive features include its cream underparts and white fur on the chin and lower lip. The animal\'s head and neck are brown, but lighter than the body, and the eyes are ringed with paler fur. Males are larger than females and have short, thick, bumpy antlers.\n\nThe species\' range once covered the shoreline up to at least 2,000\xa0m above sea level. Its habitat is in dense cogon grassland, and primary and secondary forest. Most of its habitat consists of areas where its diet of young shoots of cogon grass and young low-growing leaves and buds are plentiful. Besides areas that are dense in vegetation, it may also thrive in places where it can graze. They may also visit burnt-out forest clearings for the floral ash. Due to the now restricted range of the deer, it is not possible to ascertain the preferred habitat of the species.\n\nThe deer breed from November to December, although mating could begin earlier. Males have a roaring call to attract females. Reports mostly mention a single calf with a mated pair, although conclusive evidence on the number of young is not available because of the rarity of sightings. Calves are born after a gestation period of around 240 days. Weaning takes place at six months and the calves are mature from 12 months.\n\nThis species is fully protected under Philippine law. Hunting and forest clearances, as a result of logging activities and agricultural conversion, are thought to be the causes of a devastating drop in the numbers of the deer (a 1991 survey found that the deer was present in only 5% of its former range). Despite this, the deer still survive in the more remote areas, specifically in the protected habitats of Mt. Canlaon National Park, North Negros Forest Reserve, Southern Candoni, and West Panay Mountains (a proposed National Park). In 1990, the Philippine Spotted Deer Conservation Program was set up to facilitate the conservation of the species. Some of the deer have been held in captivity in Mari-it Conservation Centre in Panay, two breeding centers in Negros, and in a number of European zoos.\n\nSince 1987, Silliman University Mammal Conservation Program, through the Center for Tropical Studies (CENTROP), has been engaged in the deer\'s captive breeding. The success of the program has led some of the captive-bred to be released in the inland forests of southern Negros, particularly in the interior of Basay, Negros Oriental.\n\nDeforestation has greatly contributed in the decline of the deer. Hunting, both by locals and sport hunters has also made an impact; subsistence hunting, sales of venison to local markets and speciality restaurants, and live trapping for the pet trade have all contributed to the species\' dwindling numbers. Isolation and reduction of population is likely to have led to some herds becoming moribund. While cross-breeding with R. mariannus has been observed in captivity, the lack of a common range means this is unlikely to be a problem in the wild.\n\nDue to the severe pressures faced by the deer, the IUCN has twice listed it as an endangered species: firstly, in 1994 (when it was delisted within the year), and again, in 1996 (this listing has continued until the present). The limited numbers of the animal in the wild (at least 300, down from almost 1,600) has led to the belief that prospects for its survival are bleak.\n\nIn April 2009, footprints and droppings belonging to the creature were found in the North Negros Natural Park by a scientific team of six British, five Filipinos, and one Irishman, who were studying the biodiversity of the park. The team, who were from Negros Interior Biodiversity Expedition, estimate that less 300 members of the species survive. The team discovered a set of footprints beside a river three days into the expedition. The distance between these footprints and a half-eaten set of young palm trees, which were found three days later, indicated that two groups of deer might be present in the nature preserve. Subsequently, the team found small piles of 20 to 30 pellets with a trail of deer footprints leading away. Because "other species, such as the Visayan warty pig and civet have distinctly different scat", the team was confident that the pellets belonged to the deer. This was the first evidence of a live, wild population of the deer in more than ten years. The team was thrilled by their success, although one of the expedition leaders, Craig Turner, admitted "this discovery confirms [the deer] are surviving, but doesn\'t tell us they are thriving". Besides the deer, other species discovered were some unusual and endemic plants, including ground orchids and pitcher plants, and many bird and frog species. Specimens were sent to the cities of Bacolod and Dumaguete for further analysis.\n\nThe animal was later featured in a front-page story in the Philippine Daily Inquirer on 24 May 2009 in the story "The World\'s Rarest Deer Still Roam Negros". In the story, the British Ambassador declared the find "an exciting discovery". The expedition team is reportedly set to present their findings to the Royal Geographical Society. Researchers involved in the expedition commented that "more protection" of the deer and similar endangered species in the park [is needed] "in order to assure their survival". They also said in the statement that "Philippine forests still harbor many rare and unique species, found nowhere else in the world". The expedition was sponsored by several environmental institutions and foundations, which are interested in promoting and protecting the biodiversity, present within the United Kingdom as well as in the Visayas in the Philippines, such as the Negros Forests and Ecological Foundation Inc., Silliman University, Coral Cay Conservation, and the Zoological Society of London. In 2013, there were reports of sightings in the Southern Candoni region, indicating Silliman\'s releases in Basay have successfully expanded north.', 'score': 159.10388}, {'id': 'Aotidae', 'name': ['Aotidae'], 'introduction': '\n\nsee text\n\nNight monkeys, also known as owl monkeys or douroucoulis (/duːruːˈkuːliz/), are nocturnal New World monkeys of the genus Aotus, the only member of the family Aotidae (/eɪˈɒtɪdiː/). The genus comprises eleven species which are found across Panama and much of South America in primary and secondary forests, tropical rainforests and cloud forests up to 2,400 metres (7,900\xa0ft). Night monkeys have large eyes which improve their vision at night, while their ears are mostly hidden, giving them their name Aotus, meaning "earless".\n\nNight monkeys are the only truly nocturnal monkeys with the exception of some cathemeral populations of Azara\'s night monkey, who have irregular bursts of activity during day and night. They have a varied repertoire of vocalisations and live in small family groups of a mated pair and their immature offspring. Night monkeys have monochromatic vision which improves their ability to detect visual cues at night.\n\nNight monkeys are threatened by habitat loss, the pet trade, hunting for bushmeat, and by biomedical research. They constitute one of the few monkey species affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and are therefore used as experimental subjects in malaria research. The Peruvian night monkey is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an Endangered species, while four are Vulnerable species, four are Least-concern species, and two are data deficient.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'Until 1983, all night monkeys were placed into only one (A. lemurimus) or two species (A. lemurinus and A. azarae). Chromosome variability showed that there was more than one species in the genus and Hershkovitz (1983) used morphological and karyological evidence to propose nine species, one of which is now recognised as a junior synonym. He split Aotus into two groups: a northern, gray-necked group (A. lemurinus, A. hershkovitzi, A. trivirgatus and A. vociferans) and a southern, red-necked group (A. miconax, A. nancymaae, A. nigriceps and A. azarae). Arguably, the taxa otherwise considered subspecies of A. lemurinus – brumbacki, griseimembra and zonalis – should be considered separate species, whereas A. hershkovitzi arguably is a junior synonym of A. lemurinus. A new species from the gray-necked group was recently described as A. jorgehernandezi. As is the case with some other splits in this genus, an essential part of the argument for recognizing this new species was differences in the chromosomes. Chromosome evidence has also been used as an argument for merging "species", as was the case for considering infulatus a subspecies of A. azarae rather than a separate species. One extinct species is known from the fossil record.\n\nFamily Aotidae\n\nNight monkeys have large brown eyes; the size improves their nocturnal vision increasing their ability to be active at night. They are sometimes said to lack a tapetum lucidum, the reflective layer behind the retina possessed by many nocturnal animals. Other sources say they have a tapetum lucidum composed of collagen fibrils. At any rate, night monkeys lack the tapetum lucidum composed of riboflavin crystals possessed by lemurs and other strepsirrhines, which is an indication that their nocturnality is a secondary adaption evolved from ancestrally diurnal primates.\n\nTheir ears are rather difficult to see; this is why their genus name, Aotus (meaning "earless") was chosen. There is little data on the weights of wild night monkeys. From the figures that have been collected, it appears that males and females are similar in weight; the heaviest species is Azara\'s night monkey at around 1,254 grams (2.765\xa0lb), and the lightest is Brumback\'s night monkey, which weighs between 455 and 875 grams (1.003 and 1.929\xa0lb). The male is slightly taller than the female, measuring 346 and 341 millimetres (13.6 and 13.4\xa0in), respectively.\n\nNight monkeys can be found in Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela. The species that live at higher elevations tend to have thicker fur than the monkeys at sea level. Night monkeys can live in forests undisturbed by humans (primary forest) as well as in forests that are recovering from human logging efforts (secondary forest).\n\nA primary distinction between red-necked and gray-necked night monkeys is spatial distribution. Gray-necked night monkeys (Aotus lemurinus group) are found north of the Amazon River, while the red-necked group (Aotus azare group) are localized south of the Amazon River. Red-necked night monkeys are found throughout various regions of the Amazon rainforest of South America, with some variation occurring between the four species. Nancy Ma\'s night monkey occurs in both flooded and unflooded tropical rainforest regions of Peru, preferring moist swamp and mountainous areas. This species has been observed nesting in regions of the Andes and has recently been introduced to Colombia, likely as a result of post-research release into the community. The black-headed night monkey is also found mainly in the Peruvian Amazon (central and upper Amazon), however its range extends throughout Brazil and Bolivia to the base of the Andes mountain chain. Night monkeys such like the black-headed night monkey, generally inhabit cloud forests; areas with consistent presence of low clouds with a high mist and moisture content which allows for lush and rich vegetation to grow year round, providing excellent food and lodging sources. The Peruvian night monkey, like Nancy Ma\'s night monkey, is endemic to the Peruvian Andes however it is found at a higher elevation, approximately 800–2,400 metres (2,600–7,900\xa0ft) above sea level and therefore exploits different niches of this habitat. The distribution of A. azare, extends further towards the Atlantic Ocean, spanning Argentina, Bolivia and the drier, south western regions of Paraguay, however unlike the other red-necked night monkey species, it is not endemic to Brazil.\n\nDuring the daylight hours, night monkeys rest in shaded tree areas. These species have been observed exploiting four different types of tree nests, monkeys will rest in; holes formed in the trunks of trees, in concave sections of branches surrounded by creepers and epiphytes, in dense areas of epiphyte, climber and vine growth and in areas of dense foliage. These sleeping sites provide protection from environmental stressors such as heavy rain, sunlight and heat. Sleeping sites are therefore carefully chosen based upon tree age, density of trees, availability of space for the group, ability of site to provide protection, ease of access to the site and availability of site with respect to daily routines. While night monkeys are an arboreal species, nests have not been observed in higher strata of the rainforest ecosystem, rather a higher density of nests were recorded at low-mid vegetation levels. Night monkeys represent a territorial species, territories are defended by conspecifics through the use of threatening and agonistic behaviours. Ranges between night monkey species often do overlap and result in interspecific aggressions such as vocalizing and chasing which may last up to an hour.\n\nNight monkeys are primarily frugivorous, as fruits are easily distinguished through the use of olfactory cues, but leaf and insect consumption has also been observed in the cathemeral night monkey species A. azare. A study conducted by Wolovich et al., indicated that juveniles and females were much better at catching both crawling and flying insects than adult males. In general, the technique used by night monkeys in insect capturing is to use the palm of the hand to flatten a prey insect against a tree branch and then proceed to consume the carcass. During the winter months or when food sources are reduced, night monkeys have also been observed foraging on flowers such as Tabebuia heptaphylla, however this does not represent a primary food source.\n\nIn night monkeys, mating occurs infrequently, however females are fertile year-round, with reproductive cycles range from 13 to 25 days. The gestation period for night monkey is approximately 117– 159 days but varies from species to species. Birthing season extends from September to March and is species-dependent, with one offspring being produced per year; however, in studies conducted in captivity, twins were observed. Night monkeys reach puberty at a relatively young age, between 7 and 11 months, and most species attain full sexual maturity by the time they reach 2 years of age. A. azare represents an exception reaching sexual maturity by the age of 4.\n\nThe name "night monkey" comes from the fact that all species are active at night and are, in fact, the only truly nocturnal monkeys (an exception is the subspecies of Azara\'s night monkey, Aotus azarae azarae, which is cathemeral). Night monkeys make a notably wide variety of vocal sounds, with up to eight categories of distinct calls (gruff grunts, resonant grunts, sneeze grunts, screams, low trills, moans, gulps, and hoots), and a frequency range of 190–1,950\xa0Hz. Unusual among the New World monkeys, they are monochromats, that is, they have no colour vision, presumably because it is of no advantage given their nocturnal habits. They have a better spatial resolution at low light levels than other primates, which contributes to their ability to capture insects and move at night. Night monkeys live in family groups consisting of a mated pair and their immature offspring. Family groups defend territories by vocal calls and scent marking.\n\nThe night monkey is socially monogamous, and all night monkeys form pair bonds. Only one infant is born each year. The male is the primary caregiver, and the mother carries the infant for only the first week or so of its life. This is believed to have developed because it increases the survival of the infant and reduces the metabolic costs on the female. Adults will occasionally be evicted from the group by same-sex individuals, either kin or outsiders.\n\nThe family Aotidae is the only family of nocturnal species within the suborder Anthropoidea. While the order primates is divided into prosimians; many of which are nocturnal, the anthropoids possess very few nocturnal species and therefore it is highly likely that the ancestors of the family Aotidae did not exhibit nocturnality and were rather diurnal species. \xa0The presence of nocturnal behavior in Aotidae therefore exemplifies a derived trait; an evolutionary adaptation that conferred greater fitness advantages onto the night monkey. \xa0Night monkey share some similarities with nocturnal prosimians including low basal metabolic rate, small body size and good ability to detect visual cues at low light levels. Their responses to olfactory stimulus are intermediate between those of the prosimians and diurnal primate species, however the ability to use auditory cues remains more similar to diurnal primate species than to nocturnal primate species. This provides further evidence to support the hypothesis that nocturnality is a derived trait in the family Aotidae.\n\nAs the ancestor of Aotidae was likely diurnal, selective and environmental pressures must have been exerted on the members of this family which subsequently resulted in the alteration of their circadian rhythm to adapt to fill empty niches. Being active in the night rather than during the day time, gave Aotus access to better food sources, provided protection from predators, reduced interspecific competition and provided an escape from the harsh environmental conditions of their habitat. To begin, resting during the day allows for decreased interaction with diurnal predators. Members of the family Aotidae, apply the predation avoidance theory, choosing very strategic covered nests sites in trees. These primates carefully choose areas with sufficient foliage and vines to provide cover from the sun and camouflage from predators, but which simultaneously allow for visibility of ground predators and permit effective routes of escape should a predator approach too quickly. Activity at night also permits night monkeys to avoid aggressive interactions with other species such as competing for food and territorial disputes; as they are active when most other species are inactive and resting.\n\nNight monkeys also benefit from a nocturnal life style as activity in the night provides a degree of protection from the heat of the day and the thermoregulation difficulties associated. Although night monkey, like all primates are endothermic, meaning they are able to produce their own heat, night monkeys undergo behavioural thermoregulation in order to minimize energy expenditure. During the hottest points of the day, night monkeys are resting and therefore expending less energy in the form of heat. As they carefully construct their nests, night monkeys also benefit from the shade provided by the forest canopy which enables them to cool their bodies through the act of displacing themselves into a shady area. Additionally, finding food is energetically costly and completing this process during the day time usually involves the usage of energy in the form of calories and lipid reserves to cool the body down. Foraging during the night when it is cooler, and when there is less competition, supports the optimal foraging theory; maximize energy input while minimizing energy output.\n\nWhile protection from predators, interspecific interactions, and the harsh environment propose ultimate causes for nocturnal behavior as they increase the species fitness, the proximate causes of nocturnality are linked to the environmental effects on circadian rhythm. While diurnal species are stimulated by the appearance of the sun, in nocturnal species, activity is highly impacted by the degree of moon light available. The presence of a new moon has correlated with inhibition of activity in night monkeys who exhibit lower levels of activity with decreasing levels of moon light. Therefore, the lunar cycle has a significant influence on the foraging and a nocturnal behaviors of night monkey species.\n\nNight monkeys are socially monogamous—they form a bond and mate with one partner. They live in small groups consisting of a pair of reproductive adults, one infant and one to two juveniles. These species exhibit mate guarding, a practice in which the male individual will protect the female he is bonded to and prevent other conspecifics from attempting to mate with her.\xa0 Mate guarding likely evolved as a means of reducing energy expenditure when mating. As night monkey territories generally have some edge overlap, there can be a large number of individuals coexisting in one area which may make it difficult for a male to defend many females at once due to high levels of interspecific competition for mates. Night monkeys form bonded pairs and the energy expenditure of protecting a mate is reduced. Pair bonding may also be exhibited as a result of food distribution. In the forest, pockets of food can be dense or very patchy and scarce. Females, as they need energy stores to support reproduction are generally distributed to areas with sufficient food sources. Males will therefore also have to distribute themselves to be within proximity to females, this form of food distribution lends itself to social monogamy as finding females may become difficult if males have to constantly search for females which may be widely distributed depending on food availability that year.\n\nHowever, while this does explain social monogamy, it does not explain the high degree of paternal care which is exhibited by these primates. After the birth of an infant, males are the primary carrier of the infant, carrying offspring up to 90% of the time. In addition to aiding in child care, males will support females during lactation through sharing their foraged food with lactating females. Generally, food sharing is not observed in nature as the search for food requires a great degree of energy expenditure, but in the case of night monkey males, food sharing confers offspring survival advantages. As lactating females may be too weak to forage themselves, they may lose the ability to nurse their child, food sharing therefore ensures that offspring will be well feed. The act of food sharing is only observed among species where there is a high degree of fidelity in paternity. Giving up valuable food sources would not confer an evolutionary advance unless it increased an individual\'s fitness; in this case, paternal care ensures success of offspring and therefore increases the father\'s fitness.\n\nRecent studies have proposed that night monkeys rely on olfaction and olfactory cues for foraging and communication significantly more than other diurnal primate species. This trend is reflected in the species physiology; members of Aotidae possess larger scent perception organs than their diurnal counterparts. The olfactory bulb, accessory olfactory bulb and volume of lateral olfactory tract are all larger in Aotus than in any of the other new world monkey species. It is therefore likely that increased olfaction capacities improved the fitness of these nocturnal primate species; they produced more offspring and passed on these survival enhancing traits. The benefits of increased olfaction in night monkeys are twofold; increased ability to use scent cues has facilitated night time foraging and is also an important factor in mate selection and sexual attractivity.\n\nAs a substantial portion of the night monkey\'s activities occurring during the dark hours of the night, there is a much lower reliance of visual and tactile cues. When foraging at night, members of the family Aotidae will smell fruits and leaves before ingesting to determine the quality and safety of the food source. As they are highly frugivorous and cannot perceive colour well, smell becomes the primary determinant of the ripeness of fruits and is therefore an important component in the optimal foraging methods of these primates. Upon finding a rich food source, night monkeys have been observed scent marking not only the food source, but the route from their sleeping site to the food source as well. Scent can therefore be used as an effective method of navigation and reduce energy expenditure during subsequent foraging expeditions. Night monkeys possess several scent glands covered by greasy hair patches, which secrete pheromones that can be transferred onto vegetation or other conspecifics. Scent glands are often located subcaudal, but also occur near the muzzle and the sternum. The process of scent marking is accomplished through the rubbing of the hairs covering scent glands onto the desired “marked item”.\n\nOlfactory cues are also of significant importance in the process of mating and mate guarding. Male night monkeys will rub subcaudal glands onto their female partner in a process called “partner marking” in order to relay the signal to coexisting males that the female is not available for mating. Night monkeys also send chemical signals through urine to communicate reproductive receptivity. In many cases, male night monkeys have been observed drinking the urine of their female mate; it is proposed that the pheromones in the urine can indicate the reproductive state of a female and indicate ovulation. This is especially important in night monkeys as they cannot rely on visual cues, such as the presence of a tumescence, to determine female reproductive state. Therefore, olfactory communication in night monkeys is a result of sexual selection; sexually dimorphic trait conferring increased reproductive success. This trait demonstrates sexual dimorphism, as males have larger subcaudal scent glands compared to female counterparts and sex differences have been recorded in the glandular secretions of each sex. There is a preference for scents of a particular type; those which indicate reproductive receptivity, which increases species fitness by facilitating the production of offspring.\n\nAccording to the IUCN (the International Union for Conservation of Nature), the Peruvian night monkey is classified an Endangered species, four species are Vulnerable, four are Least-concern species, and two are data deficient. Most night monkey species are threatened by varying levels of habitat loss throughout their range, caused by agricultural expansion, cattle ranching, logging, armed conflict, and mining operations. To date, it is estimated that more than 62% of the habitat of the Peruvian night monkey has been destroyed or degraded by human activities. However, some night monkey species have become capable of adapting exceptionally well to anthropogenic influences in their environment. Populations of Peruvian night monkey have been observed thriving in small forest fragments and plantation or farmland areas, however this is likely possible given their small body size and may not be an appropriate alternate habitat option for other larger night monkey species. Studies have already been conducted into the feasibility of agroforestry; plantations which simultaneously support local species biodiversity. In the case of A. miconax, coffee plantations with introduced shade trees, provided quality habitat spaces. While the coffee plantation benefited from the increased shade—reducing weed growth and desiccation, night monkeys used the space as a habitat, a connection corridor or stepping stone area between habitats that provided a rich food source. However, some researchers question the agroforestry concept, maintaining that monkeys are more susceptible to hunting, predator and pathogens in plantation fields, thus indicating the need for further research into the solution before implementation.\n\nNight monkeys are additionally threatened by both national and international trade for bushmeat and domestic pets. Since 1975, the pet trade of night monkeys has been regulated by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).\xa0 In the last forty years, nearly 6,000 live night monkeys and more than 7,000 specimens have been traded from the nine countries which they call home. While the restrictive laws put into place by CITES are aiding in the reduction of these numbers, 4 out of 9 countries, show deficiencies in maintaining the standards outlined by CITES Increased attention and enforcement of these laws will be imperative for the sustainability of night monkey populations.\n\nUse in biomedical research poses another threat to night monkey biodiversity. Species such as Nancy Ma\'s night monkey, like human beings, are susceptible to infection by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite responsible for malaria. This trait caused them to be recommended by the World Health Organization as test subjects in the development of malaria vaccines. Up to 2008, more than 76 night monkeys died as a result of vaccine testing; some died from malaria, while others perished due to medical complications from the testing.\n\nIncreased research and knowledge of night monkey ecology is an invaluable tool in determining conservation strategies for these species and raising awareness for consequences of the anthropogenic threats facing these primates. Radio-collaring of free ranging primates proposes a method of obtaining more accurate and complete data surrounding primate behavior patterns. This in turn can aid in understanding what measures need to be taken to promote the conservation of these species. Radio collaring not only allows for the identification of individuals within a species, increased sample size, more detailed dispersal and range patterns, but also facilitates educational programs which raise awareness for the current biodiversity crisis.  The usage of radio-collaring while potentially extremely valuable, has been shown to interfere with social group interactions, the development of better collaring techniques and technology will therefore be imperative in the realisation and successful use of radio collars on night monkeys.', 'score': 159.08319}, {'id': 'Acanthopleura_granulata', 'name': ['Acanthopleura granulata'], 'introduction': '\n\nChiton granulatus Gmelin, 1791, Chiton blauneri Shuttleworth, 1856\n\nAcanthopleura granulata, common name the West Indian fuzzy chiton (also known as Curbs or Sea Cradles), is a medium-sized tropical species of chiton. This type of chiton\'s activity does not depend on spring-neap oscillations leading to lower locomotion loss. Its morphology is different from usual chitons as it has a fifth valve, which is split into halves.\n\nThis species is common within its range in the tropical Western Atlantic, but it is often not noticed, because its color and texture are similar to the rocks on which it lives. With not many predators the West Indian fuzzy chiton can live up to 40 years.\n\nIn countries that used to be part of the British West Indies, these and other common intertidal chitons are known as "curb"; the foot of the animal is eaten by people and is also used as bait for fishing.', 'sections': 'This species of chiton grows to be about 7\xa0cm (2.8\xa0in) in length.

This organization is due to their foraging behavior, which is limited to the nocturnal low tides.\n\nThis species lives on rocks very high in the intertidal zone. It can tolerate a lot of sun. Feeding is primarily nocturnal as there are increased levels of Hsp70, heat shock proteins which protects the organisms from environmental stressors including high temperatures, in the foot muscle under natural night time conditions . During the day, levels decrease again as the stress level protein follows the daily air temperature curve.

They are known as veado-campeiro in Portuguese and as venado or gama in Spanish. It is the only species in the genus Ozotoceros.\n\nTheir habitat includes water and hills, often with winter drought, and grass that is high enough to cover a standing deer.  Many of them live on the Pantanal wetlands, where there are ongoing conservation efforts, and other areas of annual flooding cycles.  Human activity has changed much of the original landscape.\n\nThey are known to live up to 12 years in the wild, longer if captive, but are threatened due to over-hunting and habitat loss.  Many people[who?] are concerned over this loss, because a healthy deer population means a healthy grassland, and a healthy grassland is home to many species, some also threatened.  Many North American birds migrate south to these areas, and if the Pampas deer habitat is lost, they are afraid these bird species will also decline.  There are approximately 80,000 Pampas deer total, with the majority of them living in Brazil.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'Fossil records indicate that New World deer traveled to South America from North America as part of the Great American Interchange around 2.5 million years ago, following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.  They rapidly evolved into different species, with only a few surviving today.  Due to the large continental glaciers and the high soil acidity in areas where there were no glaciers, a huge part of the fossil record has been destroyed, so there is no indication of what these early New World deer looked like.  Fossil records begin with clear differentiation and are close to what they look like now.  The Pampas deer evolved as a plains animal; their direct ancestor first appeared during the Pleistocene epoch.\n\nThe deer may have evolved without culling predators,[clarification needed] as, when alarmed, they do not flee immediately but rather stamp their feet (like many deer), have a particular trot and whistle, and deposit odor. However, feline predators, such as the puma (Puma concolor) and jaguar (Panthera onca), and even the ocelot (Felis pardalis), were once far more prevalent across the deer\'s range and were likely to have been their main threats. It is possible that with the general decline of these predators, Pampas deer have evolved to be less fearful, a potential detriment to the species\' longevity. Pampas deer have a similar gene pattern to the related marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), having two fused chromosomes.\n\nThere are five recognised subspecies:\n\nPampas deer are among the most genetically polymorphic mammals. Their current high nucleotide diversity shows that they had very large numbers in the recent past.\n\nPampas deer have tan fur, lighter on their undersides and insides of legs.  Their coats do not change with the seasons.  They have white spots above their lips and white patches on their throats.  Their shoulder height is 60–65\xa0cm (24–26\xa0in) in females and 65–70\xa0cm (26–28\xa0in) in males. Their tails are short and bushy, 10\xa0cm to 15\xa0cm long, and when they run, they lift their tail to reveal a white patch, just like white-tailed deer.\n\nAdult males typically weigh 24–34\xa0kg (53–75\xa0lb), but have been documented up to 40\xa0kg (88\xa0lb), and females typically weigh 22–29\xa0kg (49–64\xa0lb). They are a small species of deer, with relatively little sexual dimorphism.  Males have small, lightweight antlers that are 3-pronged, which go through a yearly cycle of shedding in August or September, with a new grown set by December.  The lower front main prong of the antlers is not divided, but the upper prong is.  Females have hair whorls that look like tiny antlers stubs.  Females and males have different stances during urination.  Males have a strong smell secreted from glands in their back hooves that can be detected up to 1.5\xa0km away. Compared to other small ruminants, the males have small testicles relative to their body size.\n\nIn Argentina, the mating season is December to February.  In Uruguay, the mating season is February to April.  Courtship behavior is submissive, such as low stretching, crouching, and turning away.  The male initiates courtship with a low stretch.  He makes a soft buzzing sound.  He nuzzles the female and may flick his tongue at her, and averts his eyes.  He stays near her, and may follow her for a long time, smelling her urine.  Sometimes the female responds to courtship by lying on the ground.\n\nPampas deer do not defend territory or mates, but do have displays of dominance.  They show dominance by keeping their heads up and trying to keep their side forward, and use slow, deliberate movements.  When bucks are challenging each other, they rub their horns into vegetation and scrape them on the ground.  They may urinate into the scrape they\'ve made, and sometimes defecate.  They rub the scent glands on their heads and faces into plants and objects.  They usually do not fight, but just spar with each other, and they do commonly bite.  Sparring is initiated by the smaller buck touching noses with the larger buck.\nGroups are not separated by sex, and bucks will drift between groups. There are usually only 2–6 deer in a group, but there can be many more in good feeding areas.  They do not have monogamous pairs, nor are there harems.\n\nWhen they feel they may be in danger, they hide low in the foliage and hold, and then bound off about 100–200 meters, often looking back at the disturbance.  Because they bound in long flat jumps and have not been observed to run, they are not thought to be endurance runners.  If they are alone, they may just quietly slip away.  Females with a fawn will fake a limp to distract a predator, or if they are unsure of a situation, such as if a human appears.\n\nThey will often stand on their hind legs to reach food or see over something.  They are sedentary, with no seasonal or even daily movements.  They usually feed regularly during the day, but sometimes have nocturnal activity.  \nThe Pampas deer are very curious and like to explore.  Although this is endearing to observers, their lack of fleeing at the sight of humans makes them easier for poachers to kill.\n\nPampas deer have been seen eating new green growth, shrubs, and herbs.   Most of the plant life they consume grows in moist soils.  To see if Pampas deer compete with cattle for food, their feces were studied and compared to cattle feces.  They do in fact eat the same plants, but in different proportions.  The pampas deer eat less grass and more forbs (flowering broad leafed plants with soft stems) and browse (shoots, leaves, and twigs), respectively.  During the rainy season, 20% of their diet consists of new grasses.  They will move with the availability of food, particularly the flowering plants.  The presence of cattle increases the amount of sprouting grass, which is preferred by Pampas deer, furthering the idea that the deer do not compete with cattle for food.  Opposing research shows that Pampas deer avoid areas inhabited by cattle, and when cattle are absent have much larger home ranges.\n\nFawns can be seen at any time of year, but there is a peak in September and November.  Females separate themselves from the group to give birth, and keep the fawn hidden away.  After giving birth, the female goes into heat and usually mates within the next 48 hours.  The fawns are small and spotted, and lose their spots at about two months old.  Usually only one fawn weighing about 2.2\xa0kg is born after a gestation period lasting over seven months.  At six weeks, they can eat solid food and begin to follow their mother.  They stay with their mothers for at least a year, and also reach sexual maturity at about a year.\n\nThe Pampas deer of southern Argentina, once very abundant, are now considered a threatened species by the IUCN. The IUCN separates the subspecies O. b. celer in southern Argentina as endangered.  The diseases that particularly plague O. b. celer are gut parasites and foot and mouth diseases.  Their overall decline is also due (in part) from hunting and poaching, but also from agricultural habitat loss (thus exposing deer to diseases from domesticated and feral livestock), competition from more recently-introduced wildlife, and general over-exploitation. There is less than 1% of their natural habitat left that was present in 1900. The deer in Argentina and Uruguay have fewer natural predators. They used to be the prey of cougars and many more jaguars. Those in Brazil still have the felines to fear. Some areas with low population are easily attributed to poaching, due to a sudden lower number of deer in an area. In the mid-1970s, ten individuals, out of a group of 16 located in Punta Medanos, were killed by poachers. The rest were extirpated by extensive human activity. Lack of funding and technology have made it difficult for biologists to track and aid the deer population, while donations and grants from organizations and universities in the United States have helped immensely with the situation. In 1975, there were less than 100 of the subspecies O. b. celer, but by 1980, there were around 400. The population has been continuing to increase, although not at an incredibly fast pace. One of the discrepancies is simply the fact that, later on, previously unknown subspecies and groups were discovered.\n\nLocal people often blame the deer for outbreaks of disease in their livestock, particularly Brucellosis in cattle. In one instance, the Uruguayan government was going to cull some of their Pampas deer population, until research by field veterinarians had shown that Pampas deer rarely carry the disease. Only then did the government give them time to assess the deer’s health. Funded by the Disney Conservation Fund, they were able to prove that the deer pose no threat of spreading disease to livestock.\n\nTrade for commercial purposes is banned. They are legally protected in Argentina, where there is a private and federal reserve set aside for the deer. In some areas, strict regulations on poaching is all that was necessary to quickly increase the population size. Increasing public knowledge, and monitoring road construction operations, has also helped. They reproduce well in captivity, and are sometimes reintroduced into the wild.\n\nIn 2006, GPS trackers were placed on 19 Pampas deer, although 8 of those did not record data. The individuals were monitored over a period of 4–18 days, for researchers to collect data on their movements, and thus understand how to better help them.\n\nOver the centuries, especially since European colonization, Pampas deer have been harvested in their millions. In the 1860s, documents for the Port of Buenos Aires indicate that some two million Pampas deer pelts were sent to Europe during the decade, alone. Many years later, as infrastructure was being built throughout the pampas, roads and automobiles made hunting even easier. The deer were also killed for food, medicinal purposes, and purely for sport. As of 2003, there are fewer than 2,000 Pampas deer in Argentina and Uruguay. Both countriee have declared the species to be a "natural monument" and yet the hunting continues, albeit somewhat less frequently.\n\nThe decline of the Pampas deer has been likened to that of the once-plentiful bison of North America, as the deer were once far greater in number, and held a similar place in the survival and spirituality of the native peoples of the region, including the Guaraní. The deer were revered; not only were they hunted, their carcasses blessed, and spirits thanked for their sacrifice, but the entire animal would be utilized for food, building materials, weapons, clothing, medicine, and more. Historically, the native peoples of northern Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay participated in the sale of Pampas deer pelts for export, and yet the animals persevered until European powers ultimately took-over. The settlers brought with them mass agricultural expansion and uncontrolled, unregulated hunting of wildlife, as well as new, lethal pathogens to  with the arrival of domesticated livestock. Escaped farm animals formed feral populations, thus competing with the Pampas deer and other local species for resources, in addition to exposing them to potential new diseases.\n\nSome landowners have set aside areas of their properties as undisturbed or native habitat for the deer, as well as keeping cattle instead of sheep or goats; sheep and goats compete more directly with the deer as they also browse on shrubbery and tall vegetation, far more than the grazing cattle. The landowners that choose cattle are doing it as a service, however, as sheep are far more lucrative to raise than cattle.  Conservationists encourage this trend, sharing research that more edible vegetation is available on ranches with cattle and deer during times of drought than on ranches with cattle and sheep.', 'score': 156.14513}, {'id': 'Ochroma', 'name': ['Ochroma'], 'introduction': '\n\nBombax pyramidale Cav. ex Lam.\nOchroma bicolor Rowlee\nOchroma concolor Rowlee\nOchroma lagopus Sw.\nOchroma obtusum Rowlee\n\nOchroma pyramidale, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a large, fast-growing tree native to the Americas. It is the sole member of the genus Ochroma. The tree is famous for its wide usage in woodworking, due to its softness and its high strength compared to its low density. The name balsa is the Spanish word for "raft" and the Portuguese word for ferry.\n\nA deciduous angiosperm, Ochroma pyramidale can grow up to 30\xa0m tall, and is classified as a hardwood despite the wood itself being very soft; it is the softest commercial hardwood and is widely used because of its light weight.\n\nBalsa trees grow extremely fast, often up to 27 metres in 10–15 years, and do not usually live beyond 30 to 40 years. They are often cultivated in dense patches, with Ecuador supplying 95% or more of the commercial balsa. The wood from these trees is highly valuable due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, which is achieved through a kiln-drying process that leaves the wood\'s cells hollow and empty.\n\nBalsa wood is popular for light, stiff structures in model bridge tests, model buildings, and construction of model aircraft. It is also used in the manufacturing of wooden crankbaits for fishing, makeshift pens for calligraphy, composites, surfboards, boats, "breakaway" props for theatre and television, and even in the floor pans of the Chevrolet Corvette. Balsa wood played a historical role in Thor Heyerdahl\'s Kon-Tiki\xa0expedition where it was used to build the raft. Balsa wood is also popular in arts such as whittling, and in the making of baroque-style picture frames due to its ease of shaping.', 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'sections': 'A member of the mallow family, Ochroma pyramidale is native from southern Mexico to southern Brazil, but can now be found in many other countries (Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Thailand, Solomon Islands). It is a pioneer plant, which establishes itself in clearings in forests, either man-made or where trees have fallen, or in abandoned agricultural fields. It grows extremely rapidly, up to 27 metres (89\xa0ft) in 10–15 years. The speed of growth accounts for the lightness of the wood, which has a lower density than cork. Trees generally do not live beyond 30 to 40 years.\n\nFlowers are produced from the third year onwards, typically at the end of the rainy season when few other trees are in flower. The large flowers open in the late afternoon and remain open overnight. Each may contain a pool of nectar up to 2.5 centimetres (0.98\xa0in) deep. Daytime pollinators include capuchin monkeys. However, most pollination occurs at night. The main pollinators were once thought to be bats, but recent evidence suggests that two nocturnal arboreal mammals, the kinkajou and the olingo, may be the primary pollinators.\n\nIt is evergreen or dry-season deciduous, with large 30 to 40 centimetres (12 to 16\xa0in), weakly palmately lobed leaves.\n\nBeing a deciduous angiosperm, balsa is classified as a hardwood despite the wood itself being very soft; it is the softest commercial hardwood.\n\nEcuador supplies 70% or more of commercial balsa. In recent years, about 60% of the balsa has been plantation-grown in densely packed patches of around 1000 trees per hectare (compared to about two to three per hectare in nature). The trees are harvested after six to ten years of growth in Ecuador. The remaining volume of balsa is harvested from plantations in Papua New Guinea; the climate is different, therefore harvesting occurs at 4-5 years of age.\n\nBalsa lumber is very soft and light, with a coarse, open grain. The density of dry balsa wood ranges from 40 to 475\xa0kg/m3, with a typical density around 160\xa0kg/m3. Balsa is the softest wood ever measured using the Janka hardness test (22 to 167 lbf). The wood of the living tree has large cells that are filled with water. This gives the wood a spongy texture. It also makes the wood of the living tree not much lighter than water and barely able to float. For commercial production, the wood is kiln-dried for about two weeks, leaving the cells hollow and empty. The large volume-to-surface ratio of the resulting thin-walled, empty cells gives the dried wood a large strength-to-weight ratio because the cells are mostly air. Unlike naturally rotted wood, which soon disintegrates in the rainforests where balsa trees grow, the cell walls of kiln-seasoned balsa wood retain their strong structure of cellulose and lignin.\n\nBecause it is low in density but high in specific strength (strength per weight), balsa is a very popular material for light, stiff structures in model bridge tests, model buildings, and construction of model aircraft; all grades are usable for airworthy control line and radio-controlled aircraft varieties of the aeromodeling sports, with the lightest "contest grades" especially valuable for free-flight model aircraft. However, it is also valued as a component of full-sized light wooden aeroplanes, most notably the World War II de Havilland Mosquito.\n\nBalsa is used to make wooden crankbaits for fishing, especially Rapala lures.\n\nSticks of dried balsa are useful as makeshift pens for calligraphy when commercial metal nibs of the desired width are not available.\n\nBalsa wood is often selected as a core material in composites. Because O. pyramidale grows quickly and tolerates poor soils it is lower in cost per performance compared to polymer foams like EPS while having better tensile strength than typical foams. For example, the blades of wind turbines are commonly constructed of many balsa plywood cores and internal spars covered with resin infused cloth on both sides. In table tennis rackets, a balsa layer is typically sandwiched between two pieces of thin plywood made from other species of wood. Balsa wood is also used in laminates together with glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass) for making high-quality balsa surfboards and for the decks and topsides of many types of boats, especially pleasure craft less than 30\xa0m in length. On a boat, the balsa core is usually end-grain balsa, which is much more resistant to compression than if the soft balsa wood were laid lengthwise.\n\nMore than 90% of the world\'s Balsa wood volume is prepared into end grain panels for the composites industry, mostly used as structural cores in the wind turbine blades. Where strength, rigidity, durable and environmentally sustainable materials are sought after.\n\nBalsa is also used in the manufacture of "breakaway" wooden props such as tables and chairs that are designed to be broken as part of theatre, movie, and television productions.\n\nThe fifth and sixth generations of the Chevrolet Corvette had floor pans composed of balsa sandwiched between sheets of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic.\n\nNorwegian scientist and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl, convinced that early contact between the peoples of South America and Polynesia was possible, built the raft Kon Tiki from balsa logs, and upon it his crew and he sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to the Polynesian Tuamotu Archipelago in 1947. However, the Kon Tiki logs were not seasoned and owed much of their (rather slight) buoyancy to the fact that their sap was of lower density than sea water. This serendipitously may have saved the expedition, because it prevented the seawater from waterlogging the wood and sinking the raft.\n\nBalsa wood is also a popular wood type used in the arts of whittling, and surfing. In the making of picture frames, balsa was often used in a baroque style because of the ease of shaping the design.\n\nIn parts of Africa and south America the leaves of the balsa tree are used to enhance the traditional panning method of extracting gold from ore. When mixed with water a soapy solution is produced and this helps the lighter, unwanted material to wash away.', 'score': 156.10107}, {'id': 'Epalzeorhynchos_bicolor', 'name': ['Epalzeorhynchos bicolor'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe red-tailed black shark (Epalzeorhynchos bicolor; syn. Labeo bicolor), also known as the redtail shark, red tailed shark, and redtail sharkminnow, is a species of tropical freshwater fish in the carp family, Cyprinidae. It’s named after its shark like appearance and movement, as well as its distinctive red tail. Despite its name, it is more closely related to carp. It is endemic to streams and rivers in Thailand and is currently critically endangered. However, it is common in aquaria, where it is prized for its deep black body, and vivid red orange tail. These are moderately sized tropical aquarium fish who are active benthic swimmers. They are omnivorous but are willing to scavenge if the opportunity arises. They are known for their activity as well as their temperament towards other fish. The red-tailed black sharks seen in the aquarium trade today are all captive bred.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'Red-tailed black sharks grow to be 6 inches (16 cm), but some specimens have reached 7–8 inches (18–20 cm). They have an black elongated body shape that is moderately compressed, and with the snout overhanging the mouth. As juveniles they are all thin and streamlined. However, as they age their bodies becomes deeper in the midsection, which is most prominent in females. Red-tailed black sharks have an inferior mouth that faces downwards, as well as two pairs of barbels around it. Some specimens may have small black spots just above the lateral line that can be difficult to spot in life.\n\nThe fins are all black except for the caudal fin, and occasionally the pectoral fins, which can be orange or red. Its caudal fin is forked and colored a bright red that extends to the last few scales of the caudal peduncle. The coloration of the tail can dim or fade when the individual is stressed, sick, or in poor water conditions. The pointed lobes of the caudal fin are longer and larger than its head. The dorsal fin is large and triangle shaped. It is the largest fin on the fish with the longest ray being as long as the fish is deep. The dorsal fin starts midbody but goes as far back as the peduncle, and occasionally having a white tip at the top. The anal fin is also large and triangular but smaller than the dorsal fin. The rays of the anal fin almost reaches the base of the caudal fin. The pelvic fins are triangular, are located ventrally and at the midbody, and are smaller than the anal and dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are shorter and placed lower on the body but not ventrally. The pectoral fins are often more transparent than the other fins and can be either black, clear, or orange in color.\n\nIt is difficult to discern sex of individual until around 15 months old. Females tend to be larger and wider than males. While males have brighter colors, slimmer bodies, and pointer dorsal fins.\n\nRed-tailed black sharks have a similar appearance to the Rainbow shark. They both share the shark like appearance and movement as well as the red tail. They are both common in aquaria and popular among freshwater aquarium hobbyists. They eat the same diet patrolling the bottom for food and detritus to eat. Both are largely active benthic swimmers who can be temperamental with tankmates and intolerant of their own species. The rainbow shark is also a fellow member of the Cyprinidae family. The main difference between the two is that all of the rainbow sharks’ fins are red, while only caudal and occasionally the pectoral fins of the red-tailed black sharks’ are red.\n\nThis species is endemic to Thailand, and has been recorded in the lower Mae Khlong, Chao Phraya, and Bangpakong river basins. It was described by Hugh M. Smith in 1931 as being "not uncommon in Borapet Swamp, Central Siam, and in the streams leading therefrom", and as being found in the Chao Phraya River as far south as Bangkok. A 1934 expedition reported catching a specimen in the Silom canal. Red-tailed black sharks live in lowland streams, rivers, and creeks. They prefer areas with high flow, dense vegetation, large rocks and rocky or even sandy sediment. However, from 1996 until 2011 it was believed to be extinct in the wild. In 2011 it was only known at a single location in the Chao Phraya basin, however it was believed to be strictly localized and is thought to be extirpated across the rest of its range. However, a single specimen was found in 2013 in a rocky dam around the mainstream of the Mae Khlong River in the Muang District of West Thailand.\n\nOn average these fish live 5–8 years in captivity regardless of sex. They are known egg layers, however breeding in home aquariums is practically impossible due to how aggressive and intolerant it is of its own kind. Even so breeding in captivity has been rare, but little information is known about how they spawn naturally even among enthusiasts. Little to nothing is known about what triggers breeding, what cues are used, competition, conditions, or how they choose mates. Captive breeding has been possible since at least 1987 through the injection of a mixture of hormones to induce spawning. However, they experience high mortality after spawning with rates as high as 80%. The stress and complications of hormone induced spawning leaves many adults, and their spawn, vulnerable to disease like Streptococcus iniae.\n\nRed-tailed black sharks are omnivorous scavengers who are rarely picky eaters. In the wild they eat insects, small crustaceans, worms, detritus, and plant matter. They will also eat algae off rocks, plants, and décor like many popular sucker fish in aquariums. They will scavenge recently deceased fish and animals if given the chance. They generally patrol the bottom of the water column around rocks and plants searching for food.\n\nRed-tailed black sharks are fast active swimmers that patrol the bottom of the water column. Their movement is reminiscent of sharks as they glide through the water with an oscillatory style of movement. They are known to be good jumpers and can jump out of most aquariums without a lid. Red-tailed black sharks are territorial and aggressive to other fish, and especially intolerant of other red-tailed black sharks. They will establish their own territory and will harass and chase other fish within its territory, though having a larger space with plenty of hiding places can dissipate their aggression. They may bully other fish that are smaller and slower to compete for food or space. However, their behavior and treatment towards other fish does depend on the temperament of the individual. There are cases of red-tailed black sharks living peacefully with tankmates so long as their position and territory goes unchallenged. Because of this, they are usually labeled by hobbyists as semi-aggressive since their temperament can range from territorial to hot tempered depending on the individual. They are solitary and will be aggressive and may even attack members of their own species who may compete for territory or food. Juveniles however tend to be more timid than adults, and require more hiding places to feel comfortable. Red tailed-black sharks are also nocturnal, being more active at night.\n\nCurrently the Red Tailed Black Shark is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is not well known the reason why the wild population has declined. Intense overharvesting by the aquarium trade has historically been blamed for being responsible for the species’ decline. However, this claim is still being debated with little documented evidence available to support this claim. It could be argued that the aquarium trade saved the species from extinction, as breeding of red-tailed black sharks in countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka have relieved pressure off of harvesting wild populations. Presently, current wild populations are threatened by pollution from agricultural and domestic sources, as well as from habitat modification and degradation. The construction of dams during the 1970’s, the drainage of vast areas of swamp land, as well as additional infrastructure development such as road building likely caused great loss of habitat. Pollution runoff from farmlands and domestic sources may have caused changes in flow regimes and siltation to unsuitable levels. Despite the many threats, the scope and severity that these fish face is currently unknown.\n\nThe Red Tailed Black Shark faces critical endangerment due to its disappearing rivers caused by climate change and human induced habitat destruction. As reported by the Journal of Applied Aquaculture, while most fish farmed now are for commercial purposes, artificial hormone induced spawning is extremely stressful and experiences high mortality afterwards.\n\nScientists have been trying to reduce mortality rates by recognizing the species’ economic importance and vulnerability to diseases through vaccination of diseases like Streptococcus iniae. Studies of the efficacy of vaccinating red-tailed black shark during artificial spawning have been promising, showing a reduced mortality compared to those who were not vaccinated, and lowered mortality of spawned fish fry. However, the fish that are bred in captivity may no longer be genetically suitable for release into the wild via hatchery raised reintroduction. The ICUN has recommended that an ex-situ conservation breeding program be established in captivity with the specific purpose of conservation and reintroduction to wild populations. The ICUN also recommends that further research is needed to understand the population trends, life history, ecology, threats, and actions for conservation for the red-tailed black shark.\n\nThese fish are relatively common to find in pet shops or on online aquarium stores, usually costing between $3 - $7 per fish. It is very popular in the trade, in 1987 Thailand exported as much as 5 million a year. An analysis of the most valuable ornamental fish imported into the United States in October of 1992 showed that ‘Labeo bicolor’ was the 20th most popular and valuable fish imported that year, making up 1% of total ornamental fish sales in the country. All of the ones that are sold today are captive bred, and not wild caught.\n\nIt is recommended that they are given a medium to large sized tank of 30 gallons or more. Preferably an elongated tank as they are active bottom swimmers and need more space laterally to explore than they need depth. Too small a tank can promote stress, aggression and even disease. A weighted lid is also needed to prevent jumping. They do best in fast flow with plenty of hiding spots and caves to explore and exercise. As they are tropical fish, water temperature should be between 72°-80° Fahrenheit or between 22°-26° Celsius. The pH should be close to neutral. They also do best with an air stone to produce lots of dissolved oxygen in the water.\n\nWhile these fish can be temperamental it is possible to keep tankmates with them. Faster moving fish such as danios and other minnows are fast enough to stay out of red-tailed black sharks’ way. Other larger aggressive fish such as cichlids, some gourami, and certain barbs can match their aggressiveness and keep the shark in line or hold their own. Tetras are often common tank mates, though some red-tailed black sharks do bully even these peaceful fish. However, slow moving, timid, long finned, and smaller fish are often victims of this fish’s short temper. Smaller angelfish, fancy guppies, and betta fish are poor choice of tank mates for this cyprinid. Other bottom feeders such as Corydora catfish or loaches are not recommended by some as they occupy and compete for the same territory and food. Invertebrates such as shrimp should not be added to a tank with this fish as they will be eaten.', 'score': 156.10085}, {'id': 'Felis_concolor', 'name': ['Felis concolor'], 'introduction': '\n\nAlso see text\n\nThe cougar (Puma concolor) (/ˈkuːɡər/, KOO-gər), also known as the panther, mountain lion, catamount and puma, is a large cat native to the Americas. It inhabits North, Central and South America, making it the most widely distributed wild, terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere, and one of the most widespread in the world. Its range spans the  Yukon, British Columbia and Alberta provinces of Canada, the Rocky Mountains and areas in the western United States. Further south, its range extends through Mexico to the Amazon Rainforest and the southern Andes Mountains in Patagonia. It is an adaptable generalist species, occurring in most American habitat types. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking but also lives in open areas.\n\nThe cougar is largely solitary. Its activity pattern varies from diurnality and cathemerality to crepuscularity and nocturnality between protected and non-protected areas, and is apparently correlated with the presence of other predators, prey species, livestock and humans. It is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey. Ungulates, particularly deer, are its primary prey, but it also hunts rodents. It is territorial and lives at low population densities. Individual home ranges depend on terrain, vegetation and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the dominant apex predator in its range, yielding prey to other predators. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare but increased in North America as more people entered cougar habitat and built farms.\n\nThe cougar is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Intensive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and ongoing human development into cougar habitat has caused populations to decline in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the eastern cougar population is considered to be mostly locally extinct in eastern North America since the early 20th century, with the exception of the isolated Florida panther subpopulation.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'The word cougar is borrowed from the Portuguese çuçuarana, via French; it was originally derived from the Tupi language. A current form in Brazil is suçuarana. In the 17th century, Georg Marcgrave named it cuguacu ara. Marcgrave\'s rendering was reproduced in 1648 by his associate Willem Piso. Cuguacu ara was then adopted by John Ray in 1693. In 1774, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon converted cuguacu ara to cuguar, which was later modified to "cougar" in English.\n\nThe cougar holds the Guinness record for the animal with the greatest number of names, with over 40 in English alone. "Puma" is the common name used in Latin America and most parts of Europe. The term puma is also sometimes used in the United States. The first use of puma in English dates to 1777, introduced from Spanish from the Quechua language. In the western United States and Canada, it is also called "mountain lion", a name first used in writing in 1858. Other names include "panther" (although it does not belong to the genus Panthera) and "catamount" (meaning "cat of the mountains").\n\nFelis concolor was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1771 for a cat with a long tail from Brazil. The specific epithet of the name, "concolor", is Latin for "of uniform color". It was placed in the genus Puma by William Jardine in 1834. This genus is part of the Felinae. The cougar is most closely related to the jaguarundi and the cheetah.\n\nFollowing Linnaeus\'s first scientific description of the cougar, 32 cougar zoological specimens were described and proposed as subspecies until the late 1980s. Genetic analysis of cougar mitochondrial DNA indicates that many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level but that only six phylogeographic groups exist. The Florida panther samples showed a low microsatellite variation, possibly due to inbreeding. Following this research, the authors of Mammal Species of the World recognized the following six subspecies in 2005:\n\nIn 2006, the Florida panther was still referred to as a distinct subspecies P. c. coryi in research works.\n\nAs of 2017[update], the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognizes only two subspecies as valid:\n\nLynx\n\nCheetah A. jubatus\n\nCougar\n\nJaguarundi H. yagouaroundi\n\nFelis\n\nOtocolobus\n\nPrionailurus\n\nThe family Felidae is believed to have originated in Asia about 11 million years ago (Mya). Taxonomic research on felids remains partial, and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on mitochondrial DNA analysis. Significant confidence intervals exist with suggested dates. In the latest genomic study of the Felidae, the common ancestor of today\'s Leopardus, Lynx, Puma, Prionailurus, and Felis lineages migrated across the Bering land bridge into the Americas 8.0 to 8.5\xa0million years ago. The lineages subsequently diverged in that order. North American felids then invaded South America 2–4\xa0Mya as part of the Great American Interchange, following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.\n\nThe cheetah lineage is suggested by some studies to have diverged from the Puma lineage in the Americas and migrated back to Asia and Africa, while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the Old World itself. A high level of genetic similarity has been found among North American cougar populations, suggesting they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver et al. propose the original North American cougar population was extirpated during the Pleistocene extinctions some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals, such as Smilodon, also disappeared. North America was then repopulated by South American cougars.\n\nA coprolite identified as from a cougar was excavated in Argentina\'s Catamarca Province and dated to 17,002–16,573 years old. It contained Toxascaris leonina eggs. This finding indicates that the cougar and the parasite have existed in South America since at least the Late Pleistocene. The oldest fossil record of a cougar (Puma concolor) in South America (Argentina) is a partial skull from the late Calabrian (Ensenadan) age.\n\nThe head of the cougar is round, and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has four retractile claws on its hind paws and five on its forepaws, of which one is a dewclaw. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations for clutching prey.\n\nCougars are slender and agile members of the Felidae. They are the fourth largest cat species worldwide; adults stand about 60 to 90\xa0cm (24 to 35\xa0in) tall at the shoulders. Adult males are around 2.4\xa0m (7\xa0ft 10\xa0in) long from nose to tail tip, and females average 2.05\xa0m (6\xa0ft 9\xa0in), with overall ranges between 1.50 to 2.75\xa0m (4\xa0ft 11\xa0in to 9\xa0ft 0\xa0in) nose to tail suggested for the species in general. Of this length, the tail typically accounts for 63 to 95\xa0cm (25 to 37\xa0in). Males generally weigh 53 to 72\xa0kg (117 to 159\xa0lb). Females typically weigh between 34 and 48\xa0kg (75 and 106\xa0lb). Cougar size is smallest close to the equator and larger towards the poles. The largest recorded cougar, shot in 1901, weighed 105.2\xa0kg (232\xa0lb); claims of 125.2\xa0kg (276\xa0lb) and 118\xa0kg (260\xa0lb) have been reported, though they were probably exaggerated. Male cougars in North America average 62\xa0kg (137\xa0lb), while the average female in the same region averages about 42\xa0kg (93\xa0lb). On average, adult male cougars in British Columbia weigh 56.7\xa0kg (125\xa0lb) and adult females 45.4\xa0kg (100\xa0lb), though several male cougars in British Columbia weighed between 86.4 and 95.5\xa0kg (190 and 211\xa0lb).\n\nDepending on the locality, cougars can be smaller or bigger than jaguars but are less muscular and not as powerfully built, so on average, their weight is less. Whereas the size of cougars tends to increase as much as distance from the equator increases, which crosses the northern portion of South America, jaguars are generally smaller north of the Amazon River in South America and larger south of it. For example, while South American jaguars are comparatively large, and may exceed 90\xa0kg (200\xa0lb), North American jaguars in Mexico\'s Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve weigh approximately 50\xa0kg (110\xa0lb), about the same as female cougars.\n\nCougar coloring is plain (hence the Latin concolor ["one color"] in the scientific name) but can vary greatly across individuals and even siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but it ranges from silvery-grey to reddish with lighter patches on the underbody, including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails; juveniles are pale, and dark spots remain on their flanks. A leucistic individual was seen in Serra dos Órgãos National Park in Rio de Janeiro in 2013 when it was recorded by a camera trap, indicating that pure white individuals do exist within the species, though they are extremely rare.\n\nThe cougar has large paws and proportionally the largest hind legs in the Felidae, allowing for great leaping and powerful short sprints. It can leap from the ground up to 5.5\xa0m (18\xa0ft) high into a tree.\n\nThe cougar has the most extensive range of any wild land animal in the Americas, spanning 110 degrees of latitude from the Yukon in Canada to the southern Andes in Chile. The species was extirpated from eastern North America, aside from Florida, but they may be recolonizing their former range and isolated populations have been documented east of their contemporary ranges in both the Midwestern US and Canada.\n\nThe cougar lives in all forest types, lowland and mountainous deserts, and in open areas with little vegetation up to an elevation of 5,800\xa0m (19,000\xa0ft). In the Santa Ana Mountains, it prefers steep canyons, escarpments, rim rocks and dense brush. In Mexico, it was recorded in the Sierra de San Carlos. In the Yucatán Peninsula, it inhabits secondary and semi-deciduous forests in El Eden Ecological Reserve. In El Salvador, it was recorded in the lower montane forest in Montecristo National Park and in a river basin in the Morazán Department above 700\xa0m (2,300\xa0ft) in 2019.\nIn Colombia, it was recorded in a palm oil plantation close to a riparian forest in the Llanos Basin, and close to water bodies in the Magdalena River Valley.\nIn the human-modified landscape of central Argentina, it inhabits bushland with abundant vegetation cover and prey species.\n\nCougars are an important keystone species in Western Hemisphere ecosystems, linking numerous species at many trophic levels. In a comprehensive literature review of more than 160 studies on cougar ecology, ecological interactions with 485 other species in cougar-inhabited ecosystems have been shown to involve different areas of interaction, ranging from the use of other species as food sources and prey, fear effects on potential prey, effects from carcass remains left behind, to competitive effects on other predator species in shared habitat. The most common research topic in the literature used here was the cougar\'s diet and its prey\'s regulation.\n\nThe cougar is a generalist hypercarnivore. It prefers large mammals such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, moose, mountain goat and bighorn sheep. It opportunistically takes smaller prey such as rodents, lagomorphs, smaller carnivores, birds, and even domestic animals, including pets. The mean weight of cougar vertebrate prey increases with its body weight and is lower in areas closer to the equator. A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida panther showed variation, often preferring feral hogs and armadillos. Cougars have been known to prey on introduced gemsbok populations in New Mexico. One individual cougar was recorded as hunting 29 gemsbok, which made up 58% of its recorded kills. Most gemsbok kills were neonates, but some adults were also known to have been taken. Elsewhere in the southwestern United States, they have been recorded to also prey on feral horses in the Great Basin, as well as feral donkeys in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts.\n\nInvestigations at Yellowstone National Park showed that elk and mule deer were the cougar\'s primary prey; the prey base is shared with the park\'s wolves, with which the cougar competes for resources. A study on winter kills from November to April in Alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99% of the cougar diet. Learned, individual prey recognition was observed, as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep, while others relied heavily on the species.\n\nIn the Central and South American cougar range area, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-sized mammals, including large rodents such as the capybara, are preferred. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, about half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar in South America has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items. In Central or North America, the cougar and jaguar share the same prey, depending on its abundance. Other listed prey species of the cougar include mice, porcupines, American beavers, raccoons, hares, guanacoes, peccaries, vicuñas, rheas and wild turkeys. Birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) constitute the majority of prey items in cougar diet in Patagonia\'s Bosques Petrificados de Jaramillo National Park and Monte León National Park.\n\nAlthough capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar can break the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. Kills are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around 15 months. The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days. The cougar is generally reported to not be a scavenger, but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California, suggesting more opportunistic behavior.\n\nAside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or scavengers occur. Of the large predators in Yellowstone National Park – the grizzly and black bears, gray wolf and cougar – the massive grizzly bear appears dominant, often (though not always) able to drive a gray wolf pack, black bear or cougar off their kills. One study found that grizzlies and American black bears visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of carcasses. Bears gained up to 113%, and cougars lost up to 26% of their daily energy requirements from these encounters. In Colorado and California, black bears were found to visit 48% and 77% of kills, respectively. In general, cougars are subordinate to black bears when it comes to killing, and when bears are most active, the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill. Unlike several subordinate predators from other ecosystems, cougars do not appear to exploit spatial or temporal refuges to avoid competitors.\n\nThe gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, mostly in winter. Packs of wolves can steal cougars\' kills, and there are some documented cases of cougars being killed by them. One report describes a large pack of seven to 11 wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens, while in nearby Sun Valley, Idaho, a 2-year-old male cougar was found dead, apparently killed by a wolf pack. Conversely, one-to-one confrontations tend to be dominated by the cat, and there are various documented accounts where wolves have been ambushed and killed, including adult male specimens. Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline\'s behavior. Preliminary research in Yellowstone, for instance, has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves. One researcher in Oregon noted: "When there is a pack around, cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens\xa0[...] A lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf, but the pack phenomenon changes the table." Both species are capable of killing mid-sized predators, such as bobcats, Canada lynxes, wolverines and coyotes, and tend to suppress their numbers. Although cougars can kill coyotes, the latter have been documented attempting to prey on cougar cubs.\n\nThe cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory in the southern portion of its range. The jaguar tends to take the larger prey where ranges overlap, reducing both the cougar\'s potential size and the likelihood of direct competition between the two cats. Cougars appear better than jaguars at exploiting a broader prey niche and smaller prey.\n\nThe cougar is a mostly solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting rarely. While generally loners, cougars will reciprocally share kills and seem to organize themselves into small communities defined by the territories of dominant males. Cats within these areas socialize more frequently with each other than with outsiders.\n\nIn the vicinity of a cattle ranch in northern Mexico, cougars exhibited nocturnal activity that overlapped foremost with the activity of calves. In a nature reserve in central Mexico, the activity of cougars was crepuscular and nocturnal, overlapping largely with the activity of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). Cougars in the montane Abra-Tanchipa Biosphere Reserve in southeastern Mexico displayed a cathemeral activity pattern. Data from 12 years of camera trapping in the Pacific slope and Talamanca Cordillera of Costa Rica showed cougars as cathemeral. Both cougars and jaguars in the Cockscomb Basin of Belize were nocturnal but avoided each other. In a protected cloud forest in the central Andes of Colombia, cougars were active from late afternoon to shortly before sunrise and sometimes during noon and early afternoon. In protected areas of the Madidi-Tambopata Landscape in Bolivia and Peru, cougars were active throughout the day but with a tendency to nocturnal activity that overlapped with the activity of main prey species. During an 8-year-long study in a modified landscape in southeastern Brazil, male cougars were primarily nocturnal, but females were active at night and day. Cougars were diurnal in the Brazilian Pantanal, but crepuscular and nocturnal in protected areas in the Cerrado, Caatinga and ecotone biomes. Cougars in the Atlantic Forest were active throughout the day but displayed peak activity during early mornings in protected areas and crepuscular and nocturnal activity in less protected areas. In central Argentina, cougars were active day and night in protected areas but were active immediately after sunset and before sunrise outside protected areas. Cougars displayed a foremost crepuscular and nocturnal activity pattern in a ranching area in southern Argentina.\n\nHome range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain, vegetation, and prey abundance. Research suggests a lower limit of 25\xa0km2 (9.7\xa0sq\xa0mi) and upper limit of 1,300\xa0km2 (500\xa0sq\xa0mi) of home range for males. Large male home ranges of 150 to 1,000\xa0km2 (58 to 386\xa0sq\xa0mi) with female ranges half that size. One female adjacent to the San Andres Mountains was found with a big range of 215\xa0km2 (83\xa0sq\xa0mi), necessitated by poor prey abundance. Research has shown cougar abundances from 0.5 animals to as many as seven per 100\xa0km2 (39\xa0sq\xa0mi).\n\nMale home ranges include or overlap with females but, at least where studied, not with those of other males. The home ranges of females overlap slightly. Males create scrapes composed of leaves and duff with their hind feet, and mark them with urine and sometimes feces. When males encounter each other, they vocalize and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down.\n\nCougars communicate with various vocalizations. Aggressive sounds include growls, spits, snarls, and hisses. During the mating season, estrus females produce caterwauls or yowls to attract mates, and males respond with similar vocals. Mothers and offspring keep in contact with whistles, chirps, and mews.\n\nFemales reach sexual maturity at the age of 18 months to three years and are in estrus for about eight days of a 23-day cycle; the gestation period is approximately 91 days. Both adult males and females may mate with multiple partners, and a female\'s litter can have multiple paternities. Copulation is brief but frequent. Chronic stress can result in low reproductive rates in captivity as well as in the field.\n\nGestation is 82–103 days long. Only females are involved in parenting. Litter size is between one and six cubs, typically two. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites and, after six months, beginning to hunt small prey on their own. Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter.\n\nJuveniles remain with their mothers for one to two years. When a female reaches estrous again, her offspring must disperse or the male will kill them. Males tend to disperse further than females. One study has shown a high mortality rate among cougars that travel farthest from their maternal range, often due to conflicts with other cougars. In a study area in New Mexico, males dispersed farther than females, traversed large expanses of non-cougar habitat and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches.\n\nLife expectancy in the wild is reported at 8 to 13 years and probably averages 8 to 10; a female of at least 18 years was reported killed by hunters on Vancouver Island. Cougars may live as long as 20 years in captivity. Causes of death in the wild include disability and disease, competition with other cougars, starvation, accidents, and, where allowed, hunting. The feline immunodeficiency virus is well-adapted to the cougar.\n\nThe cougar has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008. However, it is also listed on CITES Appendix II. Hunting it is prohibited in California, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and most of Argentina. Hunting is regulated in Canada, Mexico, Peru, and the United States. Establishing wildlife corridors and protecting sufficient range areas are critical for the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations showed that it faces a low extinction risk in areas larger than 2,200\xa0km2 (850\xa0sq\xa0mi). Between one and four new individuals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, thus highlighting the importance of habitat corridors.\n\nThe Florida panther population is afforded protection under the Endangered Species Act. The Texas Mountain Lion Conservation Project was launched in 2009 and aimed at raising local people\'s awareness of the status and ecological role of the cougar and mitigating conflict between landowners and cougars.\n\nThe cougar is threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and depletion of its prey base due to poaching. Hunting is legal in the western United States. In Florida, heavy traffic causes frequent accidents involving cougars. Highways are a major barrier to the dispersal of cougars. The cougar populations in California are becoming fragmented with the increase in human population and infrastructure growth in the state.\n\nHuman–wildlife conflict in proximity of 5\xa0km2 (1.9\xa0sq\xa0mi) of cougar habitat is pronounced in areas with a median human density of 32.48 inhabitants/km2 (84.1 inhabitants/sq\xa0mi) and a median livestock population density of 5.3 heads/km2 (14 heads/sq\xa0mi). Conflict is generally lower in areas more than 16.1\xa0km (10.0\xa0mi) away from roads and 27.8\xa0km (17.3\xa0mi) away from settlements.\n\nDue to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey. In a 10-year study in New Mexico of wild cougars who were not habituated to humans, the animals did not exhibit threatening behavior to researchers who approached closely (median distance=18.5 m; 61 feet) except in 6% of cases; 14⁄16 of those were females with cubs. Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1990 in North America, there were 53 reported, confirmed attacks on humans, resulting in 48 nonfatal injuries and 10 deaths of humans (the total is greater than 53 because some attacks had more than one victim). By 2004, the count had climbed to 88 attacks and 20 deaths.\n\nWithin North America, the distribution of attacks is not uniform. The heavily populated state of California saw a dozen attacks from 1986 to 2004 (after just three from 1890 to 1985), including three fatalities. In March 2024, two brothers in California were attacked by a male cougar, with one being fatally wounded; it was the state\'s first fatal attack in 20 years. Washington state was the site of a fatal attack in 2018, its first since 1924. Lightly populated New Mexico reported an attack in 2008, the first there since 1974.\n\nAs with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person "plays dead". Standing still may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey. Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.\n\nWhen cougars do attack, they usually employ their characteristic neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae and into the spinal cord. Neck, head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal. Children are at greatest risk of attack and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks before 1991 showed that 64% of all victims – and almost all fatalities – were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in British Columbia, particularly on Vancouver Island, where cougar populations are especially dense. Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, such as activity during daylight hours, a lack of fear of humans, and stalking humans. There have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people.\n\nResearch on new wildlife collars may reduce human-animal conflicts by predicting when and where predatory animals hunt. This may save the lives of humans, pets, and livestock, as well as the lives of these large predatory mammals that are important to the balance of ecosystems.\n\nCougars in the southern cone of South America are reputed to be extremely reluctant to attack people; in legend, they defended people against jaguars. The nineteenth-century naturalists Félix de Azara and William Henry Hudson thought that attacks on people, even children or sleeping adults, did not happen. Hudson, citing anecdotal evidence from hunters, claimed that pumas were positively inhibited from attacking people, even in self-defense. Attacks on humans, although exceedingly rare, have occurred.\n\nAn early, authenticated, non-fatal case occurred near Lake Viedma, Patagonia, in 1877 when a female mauled the Argentine scientist Francisco P. Moreno; Moreno afterward showed the scars to Theodore Roosevelt. In this instance, however, Moreno had been wearing a guanaco-hide poncho round his neck and head as protection against the cold; in Patagonia the guanaco is the puma\'s chief prey animal. Another authenticated case occurred in 1997 in Iguazú National Park in northeastern Argentina, when the 20-month-old son of a ranger was killed by a female puma. Forensic analysis found specimens of the child\'s hair and clothing fibers in the animal\'s stomach. The coatí is the puma\'s chief prey in this area. Despite prohibitory signs, coatis are hand-fed by tourists in the park, causing unnatural approximation between cougars and humans. This particular puma had been raised in captivity and released into the wild. On March 13, 2012, Erica Cruz, a 23-year-old shepherdess was found dead in a mountainous area near Rosario de Lerma, Salta Province, in northwestern Argentina. Claw incisions, which severed a jugular vein, indicated that the attacker was a felid; differential diagnosis ruled out other possible perpetrators.[b] There were no bite marks on the victim, who had been herding goats. In 2019 in Córdoba Province, Argentina an elderly man was badly injured by a cougar after he attempted to defend his dog from it, while in neighboring Chile a 28-year-old woman was attacked and killed in Corral, in Los Ríos Region, on October 20, 2020.\n\nFatal attacks by other carnivores, such as feral dogs, can be misattributed to cougars without appropriate forensic knowledge.\n\nDuring the early years of ranching, cougars were considered on par with wolves in destructiveness. According to figures in Texas in 1990, 86 calves (0.0006% of Texas\'s 13.4\xa0million cattle and calves), 253 mohair goats, 302 mohair kids, 445 sheep (0.02% of Texas\'s 2\xa0million sheep and lambs) and 562 lambs (0.04% of Texas\'s 1.2\xa0million lambs) were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year. In Nevada in 1992, cougars were confirmed to have killed nine calves, one horse, four foals, five goats, 318 sheep, and 400 lambs. In both reports, sheep were the most frequently attacked. Some instances of surplus killing have resulted in the deaths of 20 sheep in one attack. A cougar\'s killing bite is applied to the back of the neck, head, or throat and the cat inflicts puncture marks with its claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey, sometimes also shredding the prey as it holds on. Coyotes also typically bite the throat, but the work of a cougar is generally clean, while bites inflicted by coyotes and dogs leave ragged edges. The size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators.\n\nRemedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaints of human-cougar conflicts. In a 2013 study, the most important predictor of cougar problems was the remedial hunting of cougars the previous year. Each additional cougar on the landscape increased predation and human-cougar complaints by 5%, but each animal killed during the previous year increased complaints by 50%. The effect had a dose-response relationship with very heavy (100% removal of adult cougars) remedial hunting, leading to a 150–340% increase in livestock and human conflicts. This effect is attributed to the removal of older cougars that have learned to avoid people and their replacement by younger males that react differently to humans. Remedial hunting enables younger males to enter the former territories of the older animals. Predation by cougars on dogs "is widespread, but occurs at low frequencies".\n\nThe grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cusco is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar, and the animal also gave its name to both Inca regions and people. The Moche people often represented the cougar in their ceramics. The sky and thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal.\n\nIn North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of the Hocąk language ("Ho-Chunk" or "Winnebago") of Wisconsin and Illinois and the Cheyenne, among others. To the Apache and Walapai of the Southwestern United States, the wail of the cougar was a harbinger of death. The Algonquins and Ojibwe believe that the cougar lived in the underworld and was wicked, whereas it was a sacred animal among the Cherokee.', 'score': 155.97786}, {'id': 'Phthorimaea_operculella', 'name': ['Phthorimaea operculella'], 'introduction': '\n\nPhthorimaea operculella, also known as the potato tuber moth or tobacco splitworm, is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It is an oligophagous insect that feeds on the plant family Solanaceae and is especially known for being a major pest of potato crops. Currently farmers utilize insecticides, parasites, and sprinkler irrigation in order to prevent P. operculella from infesting their croplands.\n\nThe potato tuber moth also has a rare oviposition process where the ovipositor contains sensors that pick up on chemical signals given off by the host plant. Therefore, the adult female moth only needs to be within the vicinity of a host plant to lay her eggs.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "The potato tuber moth has a body length of about 10mm and a wingspan of about 12mm. Adult moths have a narrow, light brown body with grayish-brown wings containing a variety of small dark spots. The moth contains two sets of wings, both having frayed edges. Females are distinguished from males by having a black “X” pattern on their forewings when their wings are closed.   \n\nP. operculella can be found worldwide but prefer subtropical, tropical, and mediterranean climates. In the United States, P. operculella have been spotted in at least 25 states, especially along the Atlantic and Pacific coast. The potato tuber moth is also commonly found in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, and Oceania. In total, the moth has been reported in more than 90 countries.\n\nThe potato tuber moth typically lives in areas near potatoes or within the vicinity of their host plant family, Solanaceae. Temperature is an important factor in the survival rate and development of P. operculella, and so they are typically found in warmer climates, preferring subtropical and tropical habitats.\n\nPotato tuber moth larvae are known for feeding on the tubers, roots, and foliage (on which they are leafminers) of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum). However, larvae are only able to locate potato tubers if the tubers are exposed or within 1\xa0cm of the soil surface. There is no evidence that newly hatched larvae would burrow down and locate tubers using the root system. On foliage, the larvae mainly feed on the mesophyll, leaving brown or white spots in the leaves, known as blotch mines. The potato tuber moth has been found to feed on various members of the family Solanaceae such as tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum), eggplants (Solanum melongena), tomatoes                     (Lycopersicon esculentum), and bell peppers (Capsicum annuum).\n\nThe ovipositor of the P. operculella is approximately 1.5mm in length and 0.3mm in width. On either side of the ovipositor are approximately 30-40 tapering hairs that range from 0.03-0.3mm in length. At the tip of the ovipositor are more smaller hairs that are spaced evenly over the area.\n\nThe female potato tuber moth does not require to be on top of or inside a host plant in order to mate and lay eggs. However, full fecundity is only achieved when the moth is in the vicinity of a preferred host plant. Female adult moths look for surface depressions (cracks) that are just large enough to contain her eggs, typically 0.2-0.5\xa0mm squared. Hairy and textured surfaces are preferred over smooth and waxy surfaces. Females also strongly prefer dry places to lay her eggs and studies have shown that total number of eggs laid is reduced in the presence of moist surfaces. Shade is also preferred over bright light.\n\nExperiments published in the Entomological Society of America conducted on adult potato tuber moths have shown that the number of eggs a female contains at emergence is less than the total number of eggs laid over the total lifespan and therefore further maturation of eggs takes place during the adult life phase and depends on the amount of resources, such as food and water, that the adult is able to forage.\n\nAdult female moths prefer to oviposit on host plants from the family Solanaceae. The ovipositor contains both mechano and chemo-sensory receptors that look for certain chemical factors from plants in order to help the female moth determine which plants are preferred. A study by P. G. Fenemore from Massey University shows that potato tuber moths are drawn to an amino acid in potatoes called L-glutamic acid and that this plays a key role in helping determine plant selection for oviposition.\n\nAdult female P. operculella can lay over 200 eggs over their lifespan, depending on environmental conditions. The eggs are typically oval in shape, smooth, and have a pearly white to yellowish color. The eggs usually take around five days to hatch. The eggs can be laid on the soil next to a preferred host plant, but they are typically laid next to a vein on the leaf, between the bud and the stem, or underneath the stem.\n\nPotato tuber moth larvae are typically 12-15mm long and are white or yellow with a brown head and prothorax. As the larvae matures, its color changes from white/yellow to pink/green. The thorax contains small black spots as well as bristles on each segment, and the larvae typically feeds on its host plant for up to two weeks before pupation.\n\nIn order for the larvae to determine if it wants to mine a particular host plant, it first spends 5–15 minutes walking around the leaves, attaching a thread of silk to the surface as it goes. The larvae makes small changes in direction as it walks and occasionally bites the leaf four to five times. Once it selects a location to mine, the larvae proceeds to build a silk roof around the area and then begins to mine downwards, placing the pieces of leaf to the side of the hole.\n\nOn non-host plants, the larvae makes fewer test bites and silk deposits. On average, the larvae walks faster on a non-host plant compared to a preferred host plant and if it reaches the edge of the leaf will leave the plant all together instead of turning around.\n\nThe pupae of P. operculella are narrow in width and typically 0.5 inches in length. They are usually white in color and will take 10–30 days to develop, depending on environmental conditions.\n\nAdult potato tuber moths are nocturnal and typically are not active until 1–2 hours after sunset. At first they were thought to be poor fliers until a study by Foley in 1985 showed that they are actually capable of flying for over 5 hours and 10 kilometers non-stop in laboratory conditions. P. operculella commonly live for 1–2 weeks. Mating begins around 24 hours after emergence and most eggs are laid within the first quarter of the female's life. Peak oviposition for females occurs 2–5 days after emergence and declines to much lower levels by day 7.\n\nThe larval parasitoid wasp Apanteles subandinus was introduced as a possible strategy to control P. operculella infestations. The parasite kills the moth towards the end of its larvae stage and has been found to be successful in controlling foliar infestations of the potato tuber moth. In South Africa, the spider Selenops radiatus has proved to be an effective controlling agent for this species. The wasp Diadegma mollipla, which exists in South Africa as well, is another parasitoid of the moth's larvae.\n\nFemale potato tuber moths release a sex pheromone to attract males that has been shown to be composed of tridecadienyl and tridecatrienyl acetates. Males that sense this pheromone typically display wing fanning behavior and walk in a “zig-zagging” route towards the source.\n\nThe larvae of the potato tuber moths can be very damaging to potato crops as well as tobacco and tomato plants. The larvae will eat away at the foliage and then proceed to eat away at the tubers as well, preventing the plant from growing. At times, the larvae will eat through the potatoes themselves making them unsellable to consumers. Insecticides are commonly used to prevent and kill off potato tuber larvae but they are only effective against foliar infestations and not against infested tubers. Larval parasites such as Apanteles subandinus have also been successful in controlling foliar infestations but unfortunately do not have any significant impact on tuber infestations. The best solution to prevent the larvae from eating away at the tubers is with sprinkler irrigation as it deters the adult female moths from ovipositing.", 'score': 154.46173}, {'id': 'Cactaceae', 'name': ['Cactaceae'], 'introduction': '\n\nSee also Classification of the Cactaceae\n\nA cactus (pl.: cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae (/kækˈteɪsi.iː, -ˌaɪ/),[a] a family of the order Caryophyllales comprising about 127 genera with some 1,750 known species. The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek word κάκτος (káktos), a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. They are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north, with the exception of Rhipsalis baccifera, which is also found in Africa and Sri Lanka. Cacti are adapted to live in very dry environments, including the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. Because of this, cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. For example, almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of true leaves, cacti\'s enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis.\n\nCactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled. Many cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted with a number of ribs which corresponds to a number in the Fibonacci numbers (2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 etc.). This  allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by retention over long drought periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called "crassulacean acid metabolism" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis. Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced.\n\nMany smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration. The tallest[b] free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2\xa0m (63\xa0ft), and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana, only about 1\xa0cm (0.4\xa0in) in diameter at maturity. A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760\xa0L; 170\xa0imp\xa0gal) of water during a rainstorm. A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family. At least superficially, plants of the genera Leuenbergeria, Rhodocactus and Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them. They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems. Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many adaptations for water conservation. Leuenbergeria is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved. In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes (plants that grow on trees). Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus Schlumbergera).\n\nCacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.\n\nMany succulent plants in both the Old and New World – such as some Euphorbiaceae (euphorbias) – are also spiny stem succulents and because of this are sometimes incorrectly referred to as "cactus".[citation needed]', 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'sections': 'The 1,500 to 1,800 species of cacti mostly fall into one of two groups of "core cacti": opuntias (subfamily Opuntioideae) and "cactoids" (subfamily Cactoideae). Most members of these two groups are easily recognizable as cacti. They have fleshy succulent stems that are major organs of photosynthesis. They have absent, small, or transient leaves. They have flowers with ovaries that lie below the sepals and petals, often deeply sunken into a fleshy receptacle (the part of the stem from which the flower parts grow). All cacti have areoles—highly specialized short shoots with extremely short internodes that produce spines, normal shoots, and flowers.\n\nThe remaining cacti fall into only two groups: three tree-like genera, Leuenbergeria, Pereskia and Rhodocactus (all formerly placed in Pereskia), and the much smaller Maihuenia. These two groups are rather different from other cacti, which means any description of cacti as a whole must frequently make exceptions for them. Species of the first three genera superficially resemble other tropical forest trees. When mature, they have woody stems that may be covered with bark and long-lasting leaves that provide the main means of photosynthesis. Their flowers may have superior ovaries (i.e., above the points of attachment of the sepals and petals) and areoles that produce further leaves. The two species of Maihuenia have succulent but non-photosynthetic stems and prominent succulent leaves.\n\nCacti show a wide variety of growth habits, which are difficult to divide into clear, simple categories.\n\nCacti can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genera Leuenbergeria, Pereskia and Rhodocactus, the branches are covered with leaves, so the species of these genera may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.\n\nSmaller cacti may be described as columnar. They consist of erect, cylinder-shaped stems, which may or may not branch, without a very clear division into trunk and branches. The boundary between columnar forms and tree-like or shrubby forms is difficult to define. Smaller and younger specimens of Cephalocereus senilis, for example, are columnar, whereas older and larger specimens may become tree-like. In some cases, the "columns" may be horizontal rather than vertical. Thus, Stenocereus eruca can be described as columnar even though it has stems growing along the ground, rooting at intervals.\n\nCacti whose stems are even smaller may be described as globular (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti. Globular cacti may be solitary, such as Ferocactus latispinus, or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds. All or some stems in a cluster may share a common root.\n\nOther cacti have a quite different appearance. In tropical regions, some grow as forest climbers and epiphytes. Their stems are typically flattened and almost leaf-like in appearance, with few or even no spines. Climbing cacti can be very large; a specimen of Hylocereus was reported as 100 meters (330\xa0ft) long from root to the most distant stem. Epiphytic cacti, such as species of Rhipsalis or Schlumbergera, often hang downwards, forming dense clumps where they grow in trees high above the ground.\n\nThe majority of cacti are stem succulents, i.e., plants in which the stem is the main organ used to store water. Water may form up to 90% of the total mass of a cactus. Stem shapes vary considerably among cacti. The cylindrical shape of columnar cacti and the spherical shape of globular cacti produce a low surface area-to-volume ratio, thus reducing water loss, as well as minimizing the heating effects of sunlight. The ribbed or fluted stems of many cacti allow the stem to shrink during periods of drought and then swell as it fills with water during periods of availability. A mature saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760\xa0L; 170\xa0imp\xa0gal) of water during a rainstorm. The outer layer of the stem usually has a tough cuticle, reinforced with waxy layers, which reduce water loss. These layers are responsible for the grayish or bluish tinge to the stem color of many cacti.\n\nThe stems of most cacti have adaptations to allow them to conduct photosynthesis in the absence of leaves. This is discussed further below under Metabolism.\n\nAreoles are structures unique to cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy areas on the stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Leuenbergeria, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.\n\nAreoles are highly specialized and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes are so close together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer the top of the stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.\n\nIn most cacti, the areoles produce new spines or flowers only for a few years and then become inactive. This results in a relatively fixed number of spines, with flowers being produced only from the ends of stems, which are still growing and forming new areoles. In Pereskia,  a genus close to the ancestor of cacti, areoles remain active for much longer; this is also the case in Opuntia and Neoraimondia.\n\nThe great majority of cacti have no visible leaves; photosynthesis takes place in the stems (which may be flattened and leaflike in some species). Exceptions occur in three (taxonomically, four) groups of cacti. All the species of Leuenbergeria, Pereskia and Rhodocactus are superficially like normal trees or shrubs and have numerous leaves with a midrib and a flattened blade (lamina) on either side. This group is paraphyletic, forming two taxonomic clades. Many cacti in the opuntia group (subfamily Opuntioideae) also have visible leaves, which may be long-lasting (as in Pereskiopsis species) or produced only during the growing season and then lost (as in many species of Opuntia). The small genus Maihuenia also relies on leaves for photosynthesis. The structure of the leaves varies somewhat between these groups. Opuntioids and Maihuenia have leaves that appear to consist only of a midrib.\n\nEven those cacti without visible photosynthetic leaves do usually have very small leaves, less than 0.5\xa0mm (0.02\xa0in) long in about half of the species studied and almost always less than 1.5\xa0mm (0.06\xa0in) long. The function of such leaves cannot be photosynthesis; a role in the production of plant hormones, such as auxin, and in defining axillary buds has been suggested.\n\nBotanically, "spines" are distinguished from "thorns": spines are modified leaves, and thorns are modified branches. Cacti produce spines, always from areoles as noted above. Spines are present even in those cacti with leaves, such as Pereskia, Pereskiopsis and Maihuenia, so they clearly evolved before complete leaflessness. Some cacti only have spines when young, possibly only when seedlings. This is particularly true of tree-living cacti, such as Rhipsalis and Schlumbergera, but also of some ground-living cacti, such as Ariocarpus.\n\nThe spines of cacti are often useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, as well as in whether all the spines produced by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Sclerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).\n\nIn addition to normal-length spines, members of the subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines, called glochids, that are barbed along their length and easily shed. These enter the skin and are difficult to remove due to being very fine and easily broken, causing long-lasting irritation.\n\nMany cacti have roots that spread out widely, but only penetrate a short distance into the soil. In one case, a young saguaro only 12\xa0cm (4.7\xa0in) tall had a root system with a diameter of 2\xa0m (7\xa0ft), but no more than 10\xa0cm (4\xa0in) deep. Cacti can also form new roots quickly when rain falls after a drought. The concentration of salts in the root cells of cacti is relatively high. All these adaptations enable cacti to absorb water rapidly during periods of brief or light rainfall. Thus, Ferocactus cylindraceus reportedly can take up a significant amount of water within 12 hours from as little as 7\xa0mm (0.3\xa0in) of rainfall, becoming fully hydrated in a few days.\n\nAlthough in most cacti, the stem acts as the main organ for storing water, some cacti have in addition large taproots. These may be several times the length of the above-ground body in the case of species such as Copiapoa atacamensis, which grows in one of the driest places in the world, the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.\n\nLike their spines, cactus flowers are variable. Typically, the ovary is surrounded by material derived from stem or receptacle tissue, forming a structure called a pericarpel. Tissue derived from the petals and sepals continues the pericarpel, forming a composite tube—the whole may be called a floral tube, although strictly speaking only the part furthest from the base is floral in origin. The outside of the tubular structure often has areoles that produce wool and spines. Typically, the tube also has small scale-like bracts, which gradually change into sepal-like and then petal-like structures, so the sepals and petals cannot be clearly differentiated (and hence are often called "tepals"). Some cacti produce floral tubes without wool or spines (e.g. Gymnocalycium) or completely devoid of any external structures (e.g. Mammillaria). Unlike the flowers of most other cacti, Pereskia flowers may be borne in clusters.\n\nCactus flowers usually have many stamens, but only a single style, which may branch at the end into more than one stigma. The stamens usually arise from all over the inner surface of the upper part of the floral tube, although in some cacti, the stamens are produced in one or more distinct "series" in more specific areas of the inside of the floral tube.\n\nThe flower as a whole is usually radially symmetrical (actinomorphic), but may be bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic) in some species. Flower colors range from white through yellow and red to magenta.\n\n\n\nAll cacti have some adaptations to promote efficient water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. are xerophytes), but the first ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.\n\nThe absence of visible leaves is one of the most striking features of most cacti. Pereskia (which is close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved) does have long-lasting leaves, which are, however, thickened and succulent in many species.  Other species of cactus with long-lasting leaves, such as the opuntioid Pereskiopsis, also have succulent leaves. A key issue in retaining water is the ratio of surface area to volume. Water loss is proportional to surface area, whereas the amount of water present is proportional to volume. Structures with a high surface area-to-volume ratio, such as thin leaves, necessarily lose water at a higher rate than structures with a low area-to-volume ratio, such as thickened stems.\n\nSpines, which are modified leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing the evolution of spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near the surface of the cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration. They can provide some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.\n\nPhotosynthesis requires plants to take in carbon dioxide gas (CO2). As they do so, they lose water through transpiration. Like other types of succulents, cacti reduce this water loss by the way in which they carry out photosynthesis. "Normal" leafy plants use the C3 mechanism: during daylight hours, CO2 is continually drawn out of the air present in spaces inside leaves and converted first into a compound containing three carbon atoms (3-phosphoglycerate) and then into products such as carbohydrates. The access of air to internal spaces within a plant is controlled by stomata, which are able to open and close. The need for a continuous supply of CO2 during photosynthesis means the stomata must be open, so water vapor is continuously being lost. Plants using the C3 mechanism lose as much as 97% of the water taken up through their roots in this way. A further problem is that as temperatures rise, the enzyme that captures CO2 starts to capture more and more oxygen instead, reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis by up to 25%.\n\nCrassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a mechanism adopted by cacti and other succulents to avoid the problems of the  C3 mechanism. In full CAM, the stomata open only at night, when temperatures and water loss are lowest. CO2 enters the plant and is captured in the form of organic acids stored inside cells (in vacuoles). The stomata remain closed throughout the day, and photosynthesis uses only this stored CO2. CAM uses water much more efficiently at the price of limiting the amount of carbon fixed from the atmosphere and thus available for growth. CAM-cycling is a less water-efficient system whereby stomata open in the day, just as in plants using the C3 mechanism. At night, or when the plant is short of water, the stomata close and the CAM mechanism is used to store CO2 produced by respiration for use later in photosynthesis. CAM-cycling is present in Pereskia species.\n\nBy studying the ratio of 14C to 13C incorporated into a plant—its isotopic signature—it is possible to deduce how much CO2 is taken up at night and how much in the daytime. Using this approach, most of the Pereskia species investigated exhibit some degree of CAM-cycling, suggesting this ability was present in the ancestor of all cacti. Pereskia leaves are claimed to only have the  C3 mechanism with CAM restricted to stems. More recent studies show that "it is highly unlikely that significant carbon assimilation occurs in the stem"; Pereskia species are described as having "C3 with inducible CAM." Leafless cacti carry out all their photosynthesis in the stem, using full CAM. As of February\xa02012[update], it is not clear whether stem-based CAM evolved once only in the core cacti, or separately in the opuntias and cactoids; CAM is known to have evolved convergently many times.\n\nTo carry out photosynthesis, cactus stems have undergone many adaptations. Early in their evolutionary history, the ancestors of modern cacti (other than Leuenbergeria species) developed stomata on their stems and began to delay developing bark. However, this alone was not sufficient; cacti with only these adaptations appear to do very little photosynthesis in their stems. Stems needed to develop structures similar to those normally found only in leaves. Immediately below the outer epidermis, a hypodermal layer developed made up of cells with thickened walls, offering mechanical support. Air spaces were needed between the cells to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse inwards. The center of the stem, the cortex, developed "chlorenchyma" – a plant tissue made up of relatively unspecialized cells containing chloroplasts, arranged into a "spongy layer" and a "palisade layer" where most of the photosynthesis occurs.\n\nNaming and classifying cacti has been both difficult and controversial since the first cacti were discovered for science. The difficulties began with Carl Linnaeus. In 1737, he placed the cacti he knew into two genera, Cactus and Pereskia. However, when he published Species Plantarum in 1753—the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature—he relegated them all to one genus, Cactus. The word "cactus" is derived through Latin from the Ancient Greek κάκτος (kaktos), a name used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant, which may have been the cardoon (Cynara cardunculus).\n\nLater botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti into several genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus\'s name Cactus had become so confused as to its meaning (was it the genus or the family?) that it should not be used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.\n\nThe difficulties continued, partly because giving plants scientific names relies on "type specimens". Ultimately, if botanists want to know whether a particular plant is an example of, say, Mammillaria mammillaris, they should be able to compare it with the type specimen to which this name is permanently attached.  Type specimens are normally prepared by compression and drying, after which they are stored in herbaria to act as definitive references. However, cacti are very difficult to preserve in this way; they have evolved to resist drying and their bodies do not easily compress. A further difficulty is that many cacti were given names by growers and horticulturalists rather than botanists; as a result, the provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (which governs the names of cacti, as well as other plants) were often ignored. Curt Backeberg, in particular, is said to have named or renamed 1,200 species without one of his names ever being attached to a specimen, which, according to David Hunt, ensured he "left a trail of nomenclatural chaos that will probably vex cactus taxonomists for centuries."\n\nIn 1984, it was decided that the Cactaceae Section of the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study should set up a working party, now called the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG), to produce consensus classifications down to the level of genera. Their system has been used as the basis of subsequent classifications. Detailed treatments published in the 21st century have divided the family into around 125–130 genera and 1,400–1,500 species, which are then arranged into a number of tribes and subfamilies. The ICSG classification of the cactus family recognized four subfamilies, the largest of which was divided into nine tribes. The subfamilies were:\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have supported the monophyly of three of these subfamilies (not Pereskioideae), but have not supported all of the tribes or even genera below this level; indeed, a 2011 study found only 39% of the genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research were monophyletic. Classification of the cacti currently remains uncertain and is likely to change.\n\nA 2005 study suggested the genus Pereskia as then circumscribed (Pereskia sensu lato) was basal within the Cactaceae, but confirmed earlier suggestions it was not monophyletic, i.e., did not include all the descendants of a common ancestor. The Bayesian consensus cladogram from this study is shown below with subsequent generic changes added.\n\nPereskia s.l. Clade A → Leuenbergeria\n\nPereskia s.l. Clade B → Rhodocactus + Pereskia s.s.\n\nOpuntioideae\n\nMaihuenia\n\nCactoideae\n\nA 2011 study using fewer genes but more species also found that Pereskia s.l. was divided into the same clades, but was unable to resolve the members of the "core cacti" clade. It was accepted that the relationships shown above are "the most robust to date."\n\nLeuenbergeria species (Pereskia s.l. Clade A) always lack two key features of the stem present in most of the remaining "caulocacti": like most non-cacti, their stems begin to form bark early in the plants\' life and also lack stomata—structures that control admission of air into a plant and hence control photosynthesis. By contrast, caulocacti, including species of Rhodocactus and the remaining species of Pereskia s.s., typically delay forming bark and have stomata on their stems, thus giving the stem the potential to become a major organ for photosynthesis. (The two highly specialized species of Maihuenia are something of an exception.)\n\nThe first cacti are thought to have been only slightly succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out photosynthesis. They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If Leuenbergeria is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order Caryophyllales). These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods of rain, and keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis. The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like Pereskia species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis, to CAM cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis.\n\nThe clade containing Rhodocactus and Pereskia s.s. marks the beginnings of an evolutionary switch to using stems as photosynthetic organs. Stems have stomata and the formation of bark takes place later than in normal trees. The "core cacti" show a steady increase in both stem succulence and photosynthesis accompanied by multiple losses of leaves, more-or-less complete in the Cactoideae. One evolutionary question at present unanswered is whether the switch to full CAM photosynthesis in stems occurred only once in the core cacti, in which case it has been lost in Maihuenia, or separately in Opuntioideae and Cactoideae, in which case it never evolved in Maihuenia.\n\nUnderstanding evolution within the core cacti clade is difficult as of February\xa02012[update], since phylogenetic relationships are still uncertain and not well related to current classifications. Thus, a 2011 study found "an extraordinarily high proportion of genera" were not monophyletic, so were not all descendants of a single common ancestor. For example, of the 36 genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research, 22 (61%) were found not monophyletic. Nine tribes are recognized within Cactoideae in the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG) classification; one, Calymmantheae, comprises a single genus, Calymmanthium. Only two of the remaining eight – Cacteae and Rhipsalideae – were shown to be monophyletic in a 2011 study by Hernández-Hernández et al. For a more detailed discussion of the phylogeny of the cacti, see Classification of the Cactaceae.\n\nNo known fossils of cacti exist to throw light on their evolutionary history. However, the geographical distribution of cacti offers some evidence. Except for a relatively recent spread of Rhipsalis baccifera to parts of the Old World, cacti are plants of South America and mainly southern regions of North America. This suggests the family must have evolved after the ancient continent of Gondwana split into South America and Africa, which occurred during the Early Cretaceous, around 145\xa0to\xa0101 million years ago. Precisely when after this split cacti evolved is less clear. Older sources suggest an early origin around 90 – 66 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous. More recent molecular studies suggest a much younger origin, perhaps in very Late Eocene to early Oligocene periods, around 35–30\xa0million years ago. Based on the phylogeny of the cacti, the earliest diverging group (Leuenbergeria) may have originated in Central America and northern South America, whereas the caulocacti, those with more-or-less succulent stems, evolved later in the southern part of South America, and then moved northwards. Core cacti, those with strongly succulent stems, are estimated to have evolved around 25\xa0million years ago.  A possible stimulus to their evolution may have been uplifting in the central Andes, some 25–20\xa0million years ago, which was associated with increasing and varying aridity. However, the current species diversity of cacti is thought to have arisen only in the last 10–5\xa0million years (from the late Miocene into the Pliocene). Other succulent plants, such as the Aizoaceae in South Africa, the Didiereaceae in Madagascar and the genus Agave in the Americas, appear to have diversified at the same time, which coincided with a global expansion of arid environments.\n\nCacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high mountain areas. With one exception, they are native to the Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada. A number of centers of diversity exist. For cacti adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin. Tree-living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different centers of diversity, as they require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which is the center of diversity for the subfamily Rhipsalideae; and in forested regions of Central America, where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse.\n\nRhipsalis baccifera is the exception; it is native to both the Americas and the Old World, where it is found in tropical Africa, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka. One theory is  it was spread by  being carried as seeds in the digestive tracts of migratory birds; the seeds of Rhipsalis are adapted for bird distribution. Old World populations are polyploid, and regarded as distinct subspecies, supporting the idea that the spread was not recent. The alternative theory is the species initially crossed the Atlantic on European ships trading between South America and Africa, after which birds may have spread it more widely.\n\nMany other species have become naturalized outside the Americas after having been introduced by people, especially in Australia, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean region. In Australia, species of Opuntia, particularly Opuntia stricta, were introduced in the 19th century for use as natural agricultural fences and in an attempt to establish a cochineal industry. They rapidly became a major weed problem, but are now controlled by biological agents, particularly the moth Cactoblastis cactorum. The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however, leading to all opuntioid cacti except O. ficus-indica being declared Weeds of National Significance by the Australian Weeds Committee in April 2012.\n\nThe Arabian Peninsula has a wide variety of ever-increasing, introduced cactus populations. Some of these are cultivated, some are escapes from cultivation, and some are invasives that are presumed to be ornamental escapes.\n\nCactus flowers are pollinated by insects, birds and bats. None are known to be wind-pollinated and self-pollination occurs in only a very few species; for example the flowers of some species of Frailea do not open (cleistogamy). The need to attract pollinators has led to the evolution of pollination syndromes, which are defined as groups of "floral traits, including rewards, associated with the attraction and utilization of a specific group of animals as pollinators."\n\nBees are the most common pollinators of cacti; bee-pollination is considered to have been the first to evolve. Day-flying butterflies and nocturnal moths are associated with different pollination syndromes. Butterfly-pollinated flowers are usually brightly colored, opening during the day, whereas moth-pollinated flowers are often white or pale in color, opening only in the evening and at night. As an example, Lophocereus schottii is pollinated by a particular species of moth, Upiga virescens, which also lays its eggs among the developing seeds its caterpillars later consume. The flowers of this cactus are funnel-shaped, white to deep pink, up to 4\xa0cm (1.6\xa0in) long, and open at night.\n\nHummingbirds are significant pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red end of the spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.\n\nBat-pollination is relatively uncommon in flowering plants, but about a quarter of the genera of cacti are known to be pollinated by bats—an unusually high proportion, exceeded among eudicots by only two other families, both with very few genera. Columnar cacti growing in semidesert areas are among those most likely to be bat-pollinated; this may be because bats are able to travel considerable distances, so are effective pollinators of plants growing widely separated from one another. The pollination syndrome associated with bats includes a tendency for flowers to open in the evening and at night, when bats are active. Other features include a relatively dull color, often white or green; a radially symmetrical shape, often tubular; a smell described as "musty"; and the production of a large amount of sugar-rich nectar. Carnegiea gigantea is an example of a bat-pollinated cactus, as are many species of Pachycereus and Pilosocereus.\n\nThe fruits produced by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are fleshy, although some are dry. All contain a large number of seeds. Fleshy, colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings. Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.\n\nAs of March\xa02012[update], there is still controversy as to the precise dates when humans first entered those areas of the New World where cacti are commonly found, and hence when they might first have used them. An archaeological site in Chile has been dated to around 15,000 years ago, suggesting cacti would have been encountered before then. Early evidence of the use of cacti includes cave paintings in the Serra da Capivara in Brazil, and seeds found in ancient middens (waste dumps) in Mexico and Peru, with dates estimated at 12,000–9,000 years ago. Hunter-gatherers likely collected cactus fruits in the wild and brought them back to their camps.\n\nIt is not known when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used for a variety of purposes by the Aztecs, whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image at the center of the myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would keep moving.\n\nEuropeans first encountered cacti when they arrived in the New World late in the 15th century. Their first landfalls were in the West Indies, where relatively few cactus genera are found; one of the most common is the genus Melocactus. Thus, melocacti were possibly among the first cacti seen by Europeans. Melocactus species were present in English collections of cacti before the end of the 16th century (by 1570 according to one source,) where they were called Echinomelocactus, later shortened to Melocactus by Joseph Pitton de Tourneville in the early 18th century. Cacti, both purely ornamental species and those with edible fruit, continued to arrive in Europe, so Carl Linnaeus was able to name 22 species by 1753. One of these, his Cactus opuntia (now part of Opuntia ficus-indica), was described as "fructu majore ... nunc in Hispania et Lusitania" (with larger fruit ... now in Spain and Portugal), indicative of its early use in Europe.\n\nThe plant now known as Opuntia ficus-indica, or the Indian fig cactus, has long been an important source of food. The original species is thought to have come from central Mexico, although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties (cultivars), including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias. Both the fruit and pads are eaten, the former often under the Spanish name tuna, the latter under the name nopal. Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless. The nopal industry in Mexico was said to be worth US$150\xa0million in 2007. The Indian fig cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived, and was soon after brought to Europe. It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area, both naturally and by being introduced—so much so, early botanists assumed it was native to the area. Outside the Americas, the Indian fig cactus is an important commercial crop in Sicily, Algeria and other North African countries. Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten, generally under the same name, tuna. Flower buds, particularly of Cylindropuntia species, are also consumed.\n\nAlmost any fleshy cactus fruit is edible. The word pitaya or pitahaya (usually considered to have been taken into Spanish from Haitian creole) can be applied to a range of "scaly fruit", particularly those of columnar cacti. The fruit of the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) has long been important to the indigenous peoples of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States, including the Sonoran Desert. It can be preserved by boiling to produce syrup and by drying. The syrup can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic drink. Fruits of Stenocereus species have also been important food sources in similar parts of North America; Stenocereus queretaroensis is cultivated for its fruit. In more tropical southern areas, the climber Selenicereus undatus provides pitahaya orejona, now widely grown in Asia under the name dragon fruit. Other cacti providing edible fruit include species of  Echinocereus, Ferocactus, Mammillaria, Myrtillocactus, Pachycereus, Peniocereus and Selenicereus. The bodies of cacti other than opuntias are less often eaten, although Anderson reported that Neowerdermannia vorwerkii is prepared and eaten like potatoes in upland Bolivia.\n\nA number of species of cacti have been shown to contain psychoactive agents, chemical compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain. Two species have a long history of use by the indigenous peoples of the Americas: peyote, Lophophora williamsii, in North America, and the San Pedro cactus, Trichocereus macrogonus var. pachanoi, in South America. Both contain mescaline.\n\nL. williamsii is native to northern Mexico and southern Texas. Individual stems are about 2–6\xa0cm (0.8–2.4\xa0in) high with a diameter of 4–11\xa0cm (1.6–4.3\xa0in), and may be found in clumps up to 1\xa0m (3\xa0ft) wide. A large part of the stem is usually below ground. Mescaline is concentrated in the photosynthetic portion of the stem above ground. The center of the stem, which contains the growing point (the apical meristem), is sunken. Experienced collectors of peyote remove a thin slice from the top of the plant, leaving the growing point intact, thus allowing the plant to regenerate. Evidence indicates peyote was in use more than 5,500 years ago; dried peyote buttons presumed to be from a site on the Rio Grande, Texas, were radiocarbon dated to around 3780–3660 BC. Peyote is perceived as a means of accessing the spirit world. Attempts by the Roman Catholic church to suppress its use after the Spanish conquest were largely unsuccessful, and by the middle of the 20th century, peyote was more widely used than ever by indigenous peoples as far north as Canada. It is now used formally by the Native American Church.\n\nTrichocereus macrogonus var. pachanoi (syn. Echinopsis pachanoi) is native to Ecuador and Peru. It is very different in appearance from L.\xa0williamsii. It has tall stems, up to 6\xa0m (20\xa0ft) high, with a diameter of 6–15\xa0cm (2.4–5.9\xa0in), which branch from the base, giving the whole plant a shrubby or tree-like appearance. Archaeological evidence of the use of this cactus appears to date back to 2,000–2,300 years ago, with carvings and ceramic objects showing columnar cacti. Although church authorities under the Spanish attempted to suppress its use, this failed, as shown by the Christian element in the common name "San Pedro cactus"—Saint Peter cactus. Anderson attributes the name to the belief that just as St Peter holds the keys to heaven, the effects of the cactus allow users "to reach heaven while still on earth." It continues to be used for its psychoactive effects, both for spiritual and for healing purposes, often combined with other psychoactive agents, such as Datura ferox and tobacco. Several other species of Echinopsis, including E. peruviana and E. lageniformis, also contain mescaline.\n\nCacti were cultivated as ornamental plants from the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.\n\nCacti are often grown in greenhouses, particularly in regions unsuited to the cultivation of cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.\n\nCacti may also be planted outdoors in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions has led to the promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.\n\nCacti have many other uses. They are used for human food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines. In addition to their use as psychoactive agents, some cacti are employed in herbal medicine. The practice of using various species of Opuntia in this way has spread from the Americas, where they naturally occur, to other regions where they grow, such as India.\n\nCochineal is a red dye produced by a scale insect that lives on species of Opuntia. Long used by the  peoples of Central and North America, demand fell rapidly when European manufacturers began to produce synthetic dyes in the middle of the 19th century. Commercial production has now increased following a rise in demand for natural dyes.\n\nCacti are used as construction materials. Living cactus fences are employed as barricades around buildings to prevent people breaking in. They also used to corral animals. The woody parts of cacti, such as Cereus repandus and Echinopsis atacamensis, are used in buildings and in furniture. The frames of wattle and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea). The very fine spines and hairs (trichomes) of some cacti were used as a source of fiber for filling pillows and in weaving.\n\nAll cacti are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which "lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled." Control is exercised by making international trade in most specimens of cacti illegal unless permits have been issued, at least for exports. Some exceptions are allowed, e.g., for "naturalized or artificially propagated plants". Some cacti, such as all Ariocarpus and Discocactus species, are included in the more restrictive Appendix I, used for the "most endangered" species. These may only be moved between countries for non-commercial purposes, and only then when accompanied by both export and import permits.\n\nThe three main threats to cacti in the wild are development, grazing and over-collection. Development takes many forms. The construction of a dam near Zimapan, Mexico, caused the destruction of a large part of the natural habitat of Echinocactus grusonii. Urban development and highways have destroyed cactus habitats in parts of Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona, including the Sonoran Desert. The conversion of land to agriculture has affected populations of Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus in Mexico, where dry plains were plowed for maize cultivation, and of Copiapoa and Eulychnia in Chile, where valley slopes were planted with vines. Grazing, in many areas by introduced animals, such as goats, has caused serious damage to populations of cacti (as well as other plants);  two examples cited by Anderson are the Galápagos Islands generally and the effect on Browningia candelaris in Peru. Over-collection of cacti for sale has greatly affected some species. For example, the type locality of Pelecyphora strobiliformis near Miquihuana, Mexico, was virtually denuded of plants, which were dug up for sale in Europe. Illegal collecting of cacti from the wild continues to pose a threat.\n\nConservation of cacti can be in situ or ex situ. In situ conservation involves preserving habits through enforcement of legal protection and the creation of specially protected areas such as national parks and reserves. Examples of such protected areas in the United States include Big Bend National Park, Texas; Joshua Tree National Park, California; and Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Latin American examples include Parque Nacional del Pinacate, Sonora, Mexico and Pan de Azúcar National Park, Chile. Ex situ conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats, often with the intention of later reintroduction. Botanical gardens play an important role in ex situ conservation; for example, seeds of cacti and other succulents are kept in long-term storage at the Desert Botanical Garden, Arizona.\n\nThe popularity of cacti means many books are devoted to their cultivation. Cacti naturally occur in a wide range of habitats and are then grown in many countries with different climates, so precisely replicating the conditions in which a species normally grows is usually not practical. A broad distinction can be made between semidesert cacti and epiphytic cacti, which need different conditions and are best grown separately. This section is primarily concerned with the cultivation of semidesert cacti in containers and under protection, such as in a greenhouse or in the home, rather than cultivation outside in the ground in those climates that permit it. For the cultivation of epiphytic cacti, see Cultivation of Schlumbergera (Christmas or Thanksgiving cacti), and Cultivation of epiphyllum hybrids.\n\nThe purpose of the growing medium is  to provide support and to store water, oxygen and dissolved minerals to feed the plant. In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles Anderson says that if asked to describe a perfect growing medium, "ten growers would give 20 different answers". Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless growing medium, one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite, with the addition of soil from earthworm castings. The general recommendation of 25–75% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources. However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) "want soil that is low in or free of humus", and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a growing medium.\n\nSemi-desert cacti need careful watering. General advice is hard to give, since the frequency of watering required depends on where the cacti are being grown, the nature of the growing medium, and the original habitat of the cacti. Brown says that more cacti are lost through the "untimely application of water than for any other reason" and that even during the dormant winter season, cacti need some water. Other sources say that water can be withheld during winter (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere). Another issue is the hardness of the water; where it is necessary to use hard water, regular re-potting is recommended to avoid the build up of salts. The general advice given is that during the growing season, cacti should be allowed to dry out between thorough waterings. A water meter can help in determining when the soil is dry.\n\nAlthough semi-desert cacti may be exposed to high light levels in the wild, they may still need some shading when subjected to the higher light levels and temperatures of a greenhouse in summer. Allowing the temperature to rise above 32\xa0°C (90\xa0°F) is not recommended. The minimum winter temperature required depends very much on the species of cactus involved. For a mixed collection, a minimum temperature of between 5\xa0°C (41\xa0°F) and 10\xa0°C (50\xa0°F) is often suggested, except for cold-sensitive genera such as Melocactus and Discocactus. Some cacti, particularly those from the high Andes, are fully frost-hardy when kept dry (e.g. Rebutia minuscula survives temperatures down to −9\xa0°C (16\xa0°F) in cultivation) and may flower better when exposed to a period of cold.\n\nCacti can be propagated by seed, cuttings or grafting. Seed sown early in the year produces seedlings that benefit from a longer growing period. Seed is sown in a moist growing medium and then kept in a covered environment, until 7–10 days after germination, to avoid drying out. A very wet growing medium can cause both seeds and seedlings to rot. A temperature range of 18–30\xa0°C (64–86\xa0°F) is suggested for germination; soil temperatures of around 22\xa0°C (72\xa0°F) promote the best root growth. Low light levels are sufficient during germination, but afterwards semi-desert cacti need higher light levels to produce strong growth, although acclimatization is needed to conditions in a greenhouse, such as higher temperatures and strong sunlight.\n\nReproduction by cuttings makes use of parts of a plant that can grow roots. Some cacti produce "pads" or "joints" that can be detached or cleanly cut off. Other cacti produce offsets that can be removed. Otherwise, stem cuttings can be made, ideally from relatively new growth. It is recommended that any cut surfaces be allowed to dry for a period of several days to several weeks until a callus forms over the cut surface. Rooting can then take place in an appropriate growing medium at a temperature of around 22\xa0°C (72\xa0°F).\n\nGrafting is used for species difficult to grow well in cultivation or that cannot grow independently, such as some chlorophyll-free forms with white, yellow or red bodies, or some forms that show abnormal growth (e.g., cristate or monstrose forms). For the host plant (the stock), growers choose one that grows strongly in cultivation and is compatible with the plant to be propagated: the scion. The grower makes cuts on both stock and scion and joins the two, binding them together while they unite. Various kinds of graft are used—flat grafts, where both scion and stock are of similar diameters, and cleft grafts, where a smaller scion is inserted into a cleft made in the stock.\n\nCommercially, huge numbers of cacti are produced annually. For example, in 2002 in Korea alone, 49 million plants were propagated, with a value of almost US$9\xa0million. Most of them (31 million plants) were propagated by grafting.\n\nA range of pests attack cacti in cultivation. Those that feed on sap include mealybugs, living on both stems and roots; scale insects, generally only found on stems; whiteflies, which are said to be an "infrequent" pest of cacti; red spider mites, which are very small but can occur in large numbers, constructing a fine web around themselves and badly marking the cactus via their sap sucking, even if they do not kill it; and thrips, which particularly attack flowers. Some of these pests are resistant to many insecticides, although there are biological controls available. Roots of cacti can be eaten by the larvae of sciarid flies and fungus gnats. Slugs and snails also eat cacti.\n\nFungi, bacteria and viruses attack cacti, the first two particularly when plants are over-watered. Fusarium rot can gain entry through a wound and cause rotting accompanied by red-violet mold. "Helminosporium rot" is caused by Bipolaris cactivora (syn. Helminosporium cactivorum); Phytophthora species also cause similar rotting in cacti. Fungicides may be of limited value in combating these diseases. Several viruses have been found in cacti, including cactus virus X. These appear to cause only limited visible symptoms, such as chlorotic (pale green) spots and mosaic effects (streaks and patches of paler color). However, in an Agave species, cactus virus X has been shown to reduce growth, particularly when the roots are dry. There are no treatments for virus diseases.', 'score': 152.51833}, {'id': 'Nestoridae', 'name': ['Nestoridae'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe New Zealand parrot family, Strigopidae, consists of at least three genera of parrots – Nestor, Strigops, the fossil Nelepsittacus, and probably the fossil Heracles. The genus Nestor consists of the kea, kākā, Norfolk kākā and Chatham kākā, while the genus Strigops contains the iconic kākāpō. All extant species are endemic to New Zealand. The species of the genus Nelepsittacus were endemics of the main islands, while the two extinct species of the genus Nestor were found at the nearby oceanic islands such as Chatham Island of New Zealand, and Norfolk Island and adjacent Phillip Island.\n\nThe Norfolk kākā and the Chatham kākā have become extinct in recent times, while the species of the genus Nelepsittacus have been extinct for 16 million years. All extant species, the kākāpō, kea, and the two subspecies of the kākā, are threatened. Human activity caused the two extinctions and the decline of the other three species. Settlers introduced invasive species, such as pigs, cats, foxes, weasels, rats and possums, which eat the eggs of ground-nesting birds, and additional declines have been caused by hunting for food, killing as agricultural pests, habitat loss, and introduced wasps.\n\nThe family diverged from the other parrots around 82 million years ago when New Zealand broke off from Gondwana, while the ancestors of the genera Nestor and Strigops diverged from each other between 60 and 80 million years ago.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'No consensus existed regarding the taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The placement of the Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. The family belongs to its own superfamily Strigopoidea. This superfamily is one of three superfamilies in the order Psittaciformes; the other two families are Cacatuoidea (cockatoos) and Psittacoidea (true parrots). While some taxonomists include three genera (Nestor, Nelepsittacus, and Strigops) in the family Strigopidae, others place Nestor and Nelepsittacus in the Nestoridae and retain only Strigops in the Strigopidae. Traditionally, the species of the family Strigopoidea were placed in the superfamily Psittacoidea, but several studies confirmed the unique placement of this group at the base of the parrot tree.\n\nAn unproven hypothesis for the phylogeography of this group has been proposed, providing an example of various speciation mechanisms at work. In this scenario, ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining parrots when New Zealand broke away from Gondwana about 82 million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the two groups. This mechanism is called allopatric speciation. Over time, ancestors of the two surviving genera, Nestor and Strigops, adapted to different ecological niches. This led to reproductive isolation, an example of ecological speciation. In the Pliocene, supposedly around five million years ago, the formation of the Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus Nestor. Around three million years ago, two lineages may have adapted to high altitude and low altitude, respectively. The high-altitude lineage gave rise to the modern kea, while the low-altitude lineage gave rise to the various kākā species. Island species diverge rapidly from mainland species once a few vagrants arrive at a suitable island. Both the Norfolk kākā and the Chatham kākā are the result of migration of a limited number of individuals to islands and subsequent adaptation to the habitat of those islands. The lack of DNA material for the Chatham kākā makes it difficult to establish precisely when those speciation events occurred. Finally, in recent times, the kākā populations at the North Island and South Island became isolated from each other due to the rise in sea levels when the continental glaciers melted at the end of the Pleistocene.\n\nUntil modern times, New Zealand and the surrounding islands were not inhabited by four-legged mammals, an environment that enabled some birds to make nests on the ground and others to be flightless without fear of predation.\n\nThe parakeet species belonging to the genus Cyanoramphus (kākāriki) belong to the true parrot family Psittacidae and are closely related to the endemic genus Eunymphicus from New Caledonia. They may have reached New Zealand between 450,000 and 625,000 years ago from mainland Australia by way of New Caledonia, but this is disputed.\n\nVery little is known about the Chatham kākā. The genus Nelepsittacus consists of three described and one undescribed species recovered from early Miocene deposits in Otago. The genus Heracles consists of a giant species also described from the early Miocene of Otago.\n\n(Nestor notabilis)\nEndangered\n\n(Nestor meridionalis meridionalis)\nEndangered\n\n(Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis)\nEndangered\n\n(Nestor productus)\nExtinct by 1851 approx.\n\n(Nestor chathamensis)\nExtinct by 1500–1650\n\n(Strigops habroptila)\nCritically endangered\n\nAll common names for species in this family are the same as the traditional Māori names. The Māori word kākā derives from the ancient Proto-Polynesian word meaning parrot. Kākāpō is a logical extension of that name, as pō means night, resulting in kākā of the night or night parrot, reflecting the species\' nocturnal behaviour. (In modern orthography of the Māori language, the long versions of the vowels a and o are written with macrons; i.e., ā and ō.  Note that a long ā in Maori should be pronounced like the a in English "father". The etymology of kea in Māori is less clear; it might be onomatopoeic of its kee-aah call.\n\nThe isolated location of New Zealand has made it difficult for mammals to reach the island. This is reflected in the absence of land mammals other than bats. The main predators were birds: harriers, falcons, owls, and the massive, extinct Haast\'s eagle. Many of the adaptations found in the avifauna reflect the unique context in which they evolved. This unique balance was disrupted with the arrival of the Polynesians, who introduced the Polynesian rat and the kurī (Polynesian dog) to the island. Later, Europeans introduced many more species, including large herbivores and mammalian predators.\n\nThe three extant species of this family occupy rather different ecological niches, a result of the phylogeographical dynamics of this family. The kākāpō is a flightless, nocturnal species, well camouflaged to avoid the large diurnal birds of prey on the island, while the local owls are too small to prey on the kākāpō at night. The kākāpō is the only flightless bird in the world to use a lek-breeding system. Usually, they breed only every 3–5 years when certain podocarp trees like rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) mast abundantly.\n\nThe kea is well adapted to life at high altitudes, and they are regularly observed in the snow at ski resorts. As trees are absent in the alpine zone, they breed in hollows in the ground instead of in tree hollows like most parrot species.\n\nThe parrots were important to the Māori in various ways. They hunted them for food, kept them as pets, and used their feathers in weaving such items as their kahu huruhuru (feather cloak). Feathers were also used to decorate the head of the taiaha, a Māori weapon, but were removed prior to battle. The skins of the kākāpō with the feathers attached were used to make cloaks (kākahu) and dress capes (kahu kākāpō), especially for the wives and daughters of chiefs. Māori like to refer to the kākā in the tauparapara, the incantation to begin their mihi (tribute), because their voice (reo) is continuous.\n\nOf the five species, the Norfolk kākā and Chatham kākā became extinct in recent history. The last known Norfolk kākā died in captivity in London sometime after 1851, and only between seven and 20 skins survive. The Chatham kākā became extinct between 1500 and 1650 in pre-European times, after Polynesians arrived at the island, and is only known from subfossil bones. Of the surviving species, the kākāpō is critically endangered, with living individuals numbering only 244 (as of 2024). The mainland kākā is listed as endangered, alongside the kea.\n\nThe fauna of New Zealand evolved in the total absence of humans and other mammals. Only a few bat species and sea mammals were present prior to colonisation by humans, and the only predators were birds of prey that hunt by sight. These circumstances influence the design of New Zealand\'s parrots, for example, the flightlessness of the kākāpō and the ground breeding of the kea. Polynesians arrived at Aotearoa between 800 and 1300 AD, and introduced the kurī (dog) and kiore (Polynesian rat) to the islands. This was disastrous for the native fauna, because mammalian predators can locate prey by scent, and the native fauna had no defence against them.\n\nThe kākāpō was hunted for its meat, skin, and plumage. When the first European settlers arrived, the kākāpō was already declining, but still widespread. The large-scale clearance of forests and bush destroyed its habitat while introduced predators such as rats, cats, and stoats found the flightless, ground-nesting birds easy prey.\n\nThe New Zealand kākā needs large tracts of forest to thrive, and the continued fragmentation of forests due to agriculture and logging has a devastating effect on this species. Another threat comes from competition with introduced species for food, for example with possums for the endemic mistletoe and rata and with wasps for shimmering honeydew, an excretion of scale insects. Females, young, and eggs are particularly vulnerable in the tree hollows in which they nest.\n\nThe kea nests in holes in the ground, again making it vulnerable to introduced predators. Another major threat, resulting from development of the alpine zone, is their opportunistic reliance on human food sources as their natural food sources dwindle.\n\nRecovery programs for the kākāpō and the kākā have been established, while the kea is also closely monitored. The 244 (as of 2024) living kākāpō are all in a breeding and conservation program. Each one has been individually named.', 'score': 151.15361}, {'id': 'Atrax_yorkmainorum', 'name': ['Atrax yorkmainorum'], 'introduction': "\n\nAtrax yorkmainorum is a venomous species of Australian funnel-web spider belonging to the Atracidae family and is found in forests in the vicinity of Canberra and south-eastern New South Wales. The genus Atrax was first documented in 1877 and the Atrax yorkmainorum species was first described in 2010.\n\nThe adult male and female have a similar appearance, with the female being slightly larger. Females generally have a body length of 18.84mm whilst the male has an average body length between 16-17mm. Both sexes have a matte abdomen with a dark brown/black shiny body.\n\nFunnel web spiders are mainly nocturnal and perform their hunting, web-making and mating at night. The female Atrax yorkmainorum spends most of its time within its distinguishable burrow that is lined with silk trip lines that extrude out from the tunnel. It preys on small and large insects as well as lizards that walk across the silk trip lines. The spider will sense the vibrations from the web, then attack its prey by injecting venom with its fangs to immobilise and break down its victim. During mating, the second leg of the female spider is locked in a raised position by the characteristic dorsal spine on the males second pair of legs. Once locked in the raised position, the male releases his sperm into the females spermathecae where it is then stored until the female allows fertilisation of the eggs. Male spiderlings mature within 3–4 years of being in the burrow while the final moult for females occurs 1–2 years after the male.\n\nAtrax yorkmainorum does not have a widespread distribution within Australia, remaining within the forest areas of south-eastern New South Wales, as well as the Australian Capital Territory. Most sightings occur during the humid, wet months where male activity is at its highest. Funnel web spiders belonging to the Atrax genus are highly venomous spiders and chance of death without anti-venom is high. The venom of the male spider is significantly more toxic than the female spider's venom. The spiders venom contains neurotoxic toxins such as δ-atracotoxin, that interfere with voltage gated sodium channel activation, which is responsible for the paralyses effect of Atrax bites.\n\nSome of the systemic symptoms of Atrax yorkmainorum envenomation include mouth spasms, tongue and muscle fasciculation, nausea, hypersalivation, increased sweating and pulmonary edema. Pressure immobilisation bandaging (PIB) is used to delay envenoming until an anti-venom is accessible. \xa0An anti-venom for Atrax spider bites has been available since the late 1980s and has saved many lives from funnel web spider envenomation.", 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'Atrax yorkmainorum is an Australian mygalomorph funnel-web spider, belonging to the family Atracidae. According to historical records, O. Pickard-Cambridge was the first individual to document Atrax as a genus in 1877 in The Annals and Magazine of Natural History\n\nThe Atrax species yorkmainorum was first described in an Australian Museum review of funnel web spiders many years later in 2010 by Michael Gray. Arachnologist, Professor Barbara York Main and her husband professor Bert Main of zoology made many contributions to the arachnology and zoology field, thus the species name yorkmainorum was named after the couple. After the death of Barbra York Main, many other genera of invertebrates were named after her\n\nThe adult male of this spider species is reported to have an average body length between 16-17mm and average width of 7mm which includes the carapace (cephalothorax) and the abdomen, non-inclusive of legs. The dorsal groove present in the centre of the carapace is narrow and bent in a forward direction with small, fine hairs on the anterior carapace. The sternum of the average male is 4.43mm in length and oval-shaped with strong posterior hairs. Unlike spiders with long, slender legs such as the red back, Atrax yorkmainorum has wide legs averaging at 1.71mm with a length of 21.5mm.\n\nThe female spider differs slightly in size, averaging at 18.84mm in body length and 7.5mm in body width. The characteristics of the dorsal groove is identical to the male species, as is the sternum (4.59mm). The average length of female spider legs is approximately 18.7mm, the first and last pair being the longest for both sexes. Each spider has a pair of venomous fangs (5mm) connected to the chelicerae on each side. Both sexes have a deep dark brown or black appearance with a shiny body and matte abdomen.\n\nFeatures that distinguish Atrax yorkmainorum from Atrax robustus and Atrax sutherlandi is its slightly smaller size, absence of dorsal tibial spines on its pedipalp and the sleek, curved embolus on the male, as described by Michael, R Gray\n\nFunnel web spiders including Atrax yorkmainorum are mostly nocturnal, performing their hunting and web-making at night. The web of this species is distinguishable due to the silk trip-lines that exude out from the occupied tunnel.\n\nThe silk trip-lines are arranged in an irregular fashion lining the burrow, which extends roughly the length of an adult forearm. This arrangement allows the spider to be alerted when there are potential prey or predators at the burrow through the consequent vibrations from the silk. According to the Australian Museum, other spiders that live in burrows but possess different web patterns include the common trapdoor spider, mouse spider and wolf spider.\n\nThe diet of Atrax yorkmainorum primarily consists of small and large insects, as well as small lizards. When it comes time to hunt, the spider will remain in standby in the burrow, stalking its prey until it is alerted that there is a creature walking across the white silk lines. Once alerted that there is an insect such as a beetle or cockroach, the spider advances towards the prey, injecting venom to immobilise and liquify its target to aid in digestion. For flying insects, the spider will stand on its hind legs to strike at the insect with its front legs. When threatened, Atrax species will adopt a similar stance, raising their front legs at their potential predator.\n\nMale and female Atrax yorkmainorum possess reproductive organs and appendages that enable successful mating and reproduction. On the distal end of the male tibia, there is a characteristic spine on the second pair of legs which assists in the mating process. According to this researcher, the presence of the spine allows the females second leg to "lock... in a raised position to enable mating and...prevent descent of the female\'s fangs". The mating behaviours of funnel web spiders is similar across species, with few species-specific differences. As with hunting, mating also occurs during the night in summer and spring months. After locating a female mate through pheromone sensing, the male spider will begin the mating ritual by moving in a specific way on the female spiders\' silk trap-lines to generate vibrations that the female recognises as a mating signal rather than a prey alert.\n\nAccording to literature, the embolus of the male Atrax yorkmainorum is approximately 3mm in length with an accompanying narrow ejaculatory groove. This reproductive structure is longer in Atrax yorkmainorum species compared to the Atrax sutherlandi species (1mm difference). The embolus of the male is attached to its genital bulb, also known as the palpal organ. Once the female spider is locked in the raised position, the male inserts his long embolus into the female, releasing his semen into her curved spermathecae. Although the male ejects its sperm into the female\'s reproductive organ, the sperm will be stored in the females spermathecae before the eggs are fertilised.\n\nAfter the spiderlings hatch from the females\' egg sack, they will remain in the burrow until further maturity is reached. For the male Atrax species, this will occur within 3–4 years of being in the burrow, whilst for females, the final moulting process will occur 1–2 years after the male.\n\nAtrax yorkmainorum is not currently widespread across Australia. The distribution of these spiders is reported to be within forest areas of south-eastern New South Wales, as well as the Australian Capital Territory according to the Australian Museum records. Common places where sightings have occurred include the alpine ash Bago State Forest and Dora Dora National park in NSW and the Uriarra Forest and Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in ACT. The most recent recorded sighting of Atrax yorkmainorum was on the Mount Ainslie Walking Trail in ACT in late 2020.\n\nThe chance of encountering a funnel web spider is increased during the humid, wet months as the male is most active in these conditions as it provides a more favourable environment. Funnel web spiders are commonly found living in sheltered habitats such as under rocks or logs.\n\nFunnel web spiders belonging to the genre Atrax have been reported to be one of the most dangerous arachnoids around the world. The Sydney funnel web spider Atrax robustus is the most common species of Atrax involved in human death from spider bites. According to literature, only 10-15% of funnel web spider bites are venomous, however the toxicity of funnel web spider venom is high and chance of fatality is major. Although the incidence of bites from Atrax yorkmainorum specifically has not been widely documented, the venom of this species is of equal concern to other Atrax species. Due to the nocturnal behaviour of the Atrax species, spider bites are more frequent during summer and spring nights as the male spiders enter homes for shelter. Generally, the toxicity of spider venom is significantly higher in males than females, where species such as Atrax robustus show a 7-fold difference in toxicity.\n\nThe venom of Atrax yorkmainorum is neurotoxic and produced by specialised glands within the spider\'s mouthparts known as the chelicerae. The release of venom from the glandular lumen of the spider occurs through contraction of the muscular layers surrounding the venom gland. After contraction, the venom passes through to the fangs of the funnel web spider. The components of the spiders’ venom permit immobilisation of prey from protein substances and contains toxins that interfere with the nervous system of its victim.\n\nFor Atrax species specifically, the toxin δ-atracotoxin is responsible for the neurotoxic effects of the venom. According to studies done on newborn mice, the lethal dose of Atrax venom for these mammals is approximately 0.16\xa0mg/kg with a pH of 4.5-5. These toxins interfere with the normal function of sodium ion voltage-gated channels by slowing the inactivation of these channels. The resulting slow inactivation of sodium channels leads to inappropriate overstimulation of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, which is responsible for the paralyses effect of Atrax bites.\n\nDue to the large fang size of Atrax species (~5mm), the spider bite is painful and will usually leave a mark on its victim. The systemic symptoms of envenomation occurs within 10 minutes of the spider bite and may include effects such as mouth numbness or spams, shortness of breath and tongue fasciculation. It is common for humans to experience nausea, vomiting and increased salivation and sweating. As described in literature, in severe cases patients may experience muscle fasciculation, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat and a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Muscle and abdominal cramps are also common side effects\n\nThe effect of the venom toxin on the cardiorespiratory system is the main cause of death for individuals if anti-venom therapy is unavailable. Death from an Atrax spider bite occurs more rapidly in young children compared to adults due to their small body size. According to Professor James Tibballs, death in young children may occur approximately 15–90 minutes following an attack compared to adults which can take over 30 hours after a bite.\n\nThe protocol for treating an Atrax yorkmainorum spider bite is the same amongst all funnel web spiders. Pressure bandaging above or below the bite and immobilisation of the individual must be performed immediately if the patient develops signs of systemic envenoming. Pressure immobilisation bandaging first aid is required to delay envenoming and should only removed once the patient has been taken to a hospital or medical centre that possesses anti-venom. According to Geoffrey K Isbister, after stabilisation of the airways, two vials of anti-venom should be administered intravenously to the patient every 15–30 minutes until symptoms subside.\n\nFollowing the administration of anti-venom, the patient must be monitored for >24 hours. Acute allergic reactions to anti-venom are a possibility, however the chance of this occurring is unlikely. If the bite is minor and presents no immediate symptoms of envenomation, a minimum four-hour observation period post bite is recommended. The pressure immobilisation bandage can be removed after the first two hours of observation if anti-venom is available.\n\nThe development of anti-venom in the 1980s by Dr. Struan Sutherland has prevented many deaths from envenomation since it became available. If hyper secretion is still occurring in the patient, a dose of 0.6-1.2\xa0mg of atropine can be administered to an adult, or 0.02\xa0mg/kg to a child.', 'score': 150.69608}, {'id': 'Aotus_griseimembra', 'name': ['Aotus griseimembra'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe gray-handed night monkey (Aotus griseimembra) is a species of night monkey formerly considered a subspecies of Gray-bellied night monkey of the family Aotidae. Its range consists of parts of Colombia and Venezuela. The exact classification of the gray-handed night monkey is uncertain.  While some authors consider it a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey, A. lemurinus, other authors consider it a separate species,  A. griseimembra.\n\nIn Colombia, its range consists of the northern portion from the Sinú River (or perhaps further east) to the Venezuelan border, including the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Magdalena River, Cauca River and Sao Jorge River valleys. In Venezuela, it is found to the west and south of Maracaibo.\n\nThe gray-handed night monkey is a relatively small monkey, with males weighing approximately 1,009 grams (35.6\xa0oz) and females weighing about 923 grams (32.6\xa0oz). It has short, tight fur.  The fur on the back ranges from grayish brown to reddish brown.  The belly is yellowish.  The hair on the back of the hands and feet is the color of light coffee with darker hair tips, a key distinguishing feature from other A. lemurinus subspecies.\n\nThe gray-handed night monkey is arboreal and nocturnal. It and the other members of the genus Aotus are the only nocturnal monkeys. Laboratory experiments indicated lower levels of activity even in lighting conditions consistent with a full moon. It is found in several types of forest, including secondary forest and coffee plantations, although one study indicated a preference for highly diverse forest. It lives in small groups of between two and six monkeys, most typically two to four, consisting of an adult pair and one infant and several juveniles and/or subadults. Groups are territorial, and groups occupy ranges that overlap only slightly. One study found a population density of 1.5 monkeys per square kilometer, while another found a density of 150 monkeys per square kilometer. The latter figure occurred in a forest remnant that had served as a refuge, which may account for the extremely high density.\n\nIn common with other night monkeys, the gray-handed night monkey is one of the few monogamous monkeys. The monogamous pair generally gives birth to a single infant each year, although twins occasionally occur. The gestation period is about 133 days. The father carries the infant from the time it is one or two days old, passing it to the mother for nursing. Average interbirth interval for the mother is 271 days.\n\nThe gray-handed night monkey is listed as "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  It is believed to be particularly threatened in Colombia.  This is in part due to habitat loss, but also because many were captured in the 1960s and 1970s for malaria research.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'score': 148.42827}]}}
