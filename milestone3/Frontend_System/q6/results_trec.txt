It is commonly known as the Australian carpet beetle and is one of the most researched of the thirty-one species in the Anthrenocerus genus. This is generally attributed to its prevalence throughout Australia and New Zealand and the negative economic and agricultural impact it has as a pest. It is the larvae that causes damage to products, not the adult beetle. The total life cycle of this insect is around three years, most of which is spent as a larva. Once the beetle reaches maturity, it only lives for between two and six weeks.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "The adult A. australis is a dark brown and black oval beetle, which grows to be around 2.2-2.5mm long. At the front of the head are two small eyes and a pair of antennae. Below are six outward facing legs and a mouth. The back of the beetle's body has a hardened shell to provide protection for the delicate wings which retract beneath when the beetle is not in flight. When disturbed or threatened the beetle will freeze up and fold their legs into their body.\n\nThe A. australis larvae are hairy and stretched to form an eruciform (caterpillar-like) shape. They are “grub-like”and can grow up to 7mm long, have a head and mouth with six legs at the front of the body and an extended abdomen. The larvae are covered in spicisetae which are long hairs that provide protection for the adolescent against predators. Upon perceiving a threat, the hairs are erected to sharp needles, and lodge themselves into the predator. A notable feature of the A. australis larvae is their white and tan “colourful and distinctive patterned” complete setal bands.\n\nAfter mating, the female flies to a location where the eggs are hidden and safe and, when hatched, the larvae can feed on. Capable of laying up to forty tiny “oval shaped and cream coloured eggs”, smaller than one millimetre, the female lays each egg at a different location in crevasses of fibrous or animal products such as wool, cotton, or the hair and skin of dead animals. The eggs are laid separately for maximum probability of survival and generally take between ten and twenty days to hatch. The female chooses insulated and well protected commodities to lay their eggs, so upon hatching, the larvae has a source of food. Larvae hatch from eggs in the spring and early summer. Once hatched, the larvae burrow into the material they were laid in and feed. Larvae are scavengers and prefer consuming natural fibres such as “silk, leather, feathers, wool and hair; and plant fibres such as cotton and other foodstuffs. Larvae also feed on the skin and hair of dead animals and insects; and spiders’ webs”.\n\nThroughout their larval stage, the immature beetle performs ecdysis (moulting) several times, marking a new stage of their development. Larvae can live for between one and three years, and during cold periods can hibernate until warmer weather returns. ). In a protected and artificial environment, such as a glass jar, Wakley noted the larvae continued to thrive for over twenty years. During warmer weather, and in a dark setting such as the source of food they have habituated, the larvae will shed its skin for the final time and become a pupa for between ten and thirty days, and finally transform into the mature A. australis beetle. Unlike its preference as a larva, the adult beetle is attracted to light and is commonly found outside searching for food and feeds on pollen and nectar from flowers. The fully-grown adult beetle will live in nests and dead animal remains. The beetle may also be found in bee, wasp and ant nests, although as they are all natural predators to A. australis, host a risk of the beetle being eaten. Some of the common predators of A. australis are “birds, mammals, lizards, frogs, ants, spiders and parasitoid wasp larvae.” As a fully mature adult, A. australis’ life span is only between two and six weeks.\n\nAnthrenocerus australis was discovered by an English entomologist named Fredrick William Hope (Hope, 1843) who discovered, collected and named many species of beetles. The adult beetles do not need food to produce viable eggs. This may be a cause for the pervasive spread of the beetle, as they can reproduce on any surface even without consuming food and water. Gerrard noted the beetle’s behaviour while being studied would to be to “seek out nectar sources if possible, perhaps after laying their first batch of eggs… and encourage dispersal of the species.” Because the beetle seems to prioritise reproduction over feeding, the distribution of the beetle through imported and exported products have resulted in cases all over the world including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Belgium.\n\nAnthrenocerus australis is not affected by the British winter, indicative of their survival in Britain for the last century, but during the summer the temperature may not rise enough to promote a healthy rate of breeding. Due to this, A. australis is not considered a pest in Britain. While this beetle is not considered an important pest in these countries, A. australis has a high-ranked pest status in New Zealand.\n\nIn 1948 there were reports of large-scale infestations of A. australis in New Zealand. Today, they are considered one of the biggest economic and resource damaging pests in both the North and South island. The beetles are often found eating grain and oat in silos and dried dairy products such as casein. They are also often found in woolen carpets and fabrics, of which they also eat. Alongside agricultural issues, the beetle is a problem in museums, “attacking dried artefacts or organic origin and woolen goods”. Introduced into Britain in 1933, when an infestation was discovered and then following, became a household pest in 1945. According to records, the beetle has been discovered in many places feeding off dust, fruit and food scraps. Some of these places include a printing office, London wharf and private residences.\n\nIn New Zealand, A. australis has developed a significant resistance to the most common wool insecticide permethrin.\n\nIn 1997, a study conducted in Belgium, the authors surmised that insects and mites cause around 30% of all stored food to become irreversibly damaged or eaten. Furthermore, as pesticides have become a standard practice of the mitigation of pests in agriculture, so have those pests developed a resistance to the efficacy of many pesticides. According to experts in the field of pest control and mitigation, a specific formula of chemicals containing permethrin are effective against most keratin consuming insects, including A. australis. On an industrial scale, this chemical is favoured as it is an indiscriminate chemical affecting and killing most insects who come into contact with it. Bees do not seem to be affected by the chemical, which is beneficial for farmers and the ecosystems they contribute to.\n\nAnother commonly used chemical is propiconazole, a compound which, when used to treat wool has shown results of the larvae consuming significantly less, as a result of gut or taste-related differences. While it is notably effective across a range of insects, this particular chemical showed to have the “greatest protective effect” on A. australis when dyed at as little ratio of 4:1000 on mass of wool to give full protection from the insect. While these chemicals do protect against agricultural goods, they are often discarded into waterways, poisoning almost all species of the aquatic ecosystem.\n\nAnother method more commonly used is simply storing the grain and fabric products in an environment which is not conducive to the survival of pests (Boyer, Zhang and Lempérière, 2011). Beetles require oxygen, so a low concentration of oxygen and a large concentration of carbon dioxide is a commonly practiced method of controlling the damage caused by the larvae. Concentrations of carbon dioxide 40% and more, at a consistent level, will likely kill all insects within two weeks. The cause of death is “anoxia and hypercarbia”.\n\nDue to the fact adult beetles mostly live outside, permanent mitigation is almost impossible as the beetle can return with a new batch of eggs. It is recommended that regular cleaning occur, specifically taking note to the corners and edges of carpets, and to spray with an insecticide in the time period when the larvae are likely to hatch. Reinfestation can occur on through many means including bringing cut flowers into the house.", 'score': 993.02057}, {'id': 'Platydemus_manokwari', 'name': ['Platydemus manokwari'], 'introduction': '\n\nPlatydemus manokwari, also known as the New Guinea flatworm, is a species of large predatory land flatworm.\n\nNative to New Guinea, it has been accidentally introduced to the soil of many countries, including the United States. It was also deliberately introduced into two Pacific islands in an attempt to control an invasion of the giant African land snail.[citation needed] It eats a variety of invertebrates including land snails, and has had a significant negative impact on the rare endemic land snail fauna of some Pacific islands. It has become established in a wide variety of habitats.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'It is relatively large, about 40–65 millimetres (1.6–2.6 inches) in length and about 4–7 millimetres (0.16–0.28 inches) wide. Its body, however, is quite flat, being less than 2 millimetres (0.08 inches) in thickness. Both ends of the animal are pointed, but the head end is more pointed than the tail end. Near the tip of the head end are two eyes. It is dark brown on the upper surface, with a lighter central line. The underside is pale grey.\n\nP. manokwari is native to the island of New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean. This species of large flatworm preys on land mollusks and has been categorized as one of the 100 worst invasive species.\n\nThe original habitat of P. manokwari is within tropical areas, but it has been found in almost all temperate regions of the world including in agricultural, coastland, and disturbed areas, as well as, natural forests, planted forests, riparian zones, scrub/shrublands, urban areas, and wetlands. However, P. manokwari does not live in urban coastal areas, perhaps due to environmental factors, such as lack of vegetation.\n\nP. manokwari mainly preys on small land snails, but it has been known to feed on various soil invertebrates, such as earthworms, slugs, and arthropods. Platydemus manokwari is the main predator of land mollusks, and preys upon the snails during most of their life cycle including young hatchlings. Furthermore, P. manokwari does not recognize early-stage snail eggs as a possible food source, but it does feed on young hatchlings and late-stage eggs of land snails. Platydemus manokwari uses a chemical-based tracking method to follow snail mucus trails and track down its prey, sometimes even into trees. In areas where the land snail population has been exhausted, it has been known to eat other flatworms.\nThe diet of Platydemus manokwari is also affected seasonally. According to studies done by Sugiura, more than 90% of the land snails were preyed upon by P. manokwari in the period from July to November, and only 40% of the land snails were eaten during the other months. It was thus found that there was a positive correlation between snail mortality and temperature. This seasonal difference can be explained by different foraging behaviors, different microclimatic conditions, and different densities.\n\nA rare observation of Platydemus manokwari scavenging on a dead human body was reported in 2024 in Australia. Several flatworms were attached to the body and were associated with areas of skin loss.\n\nThere are no known predators of P. manokwari.  However, it is a paratenic host for the nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis, also known as the rat lungworm.  This nematode parasitizes P. manokwari as well as the giant African land snail, and both of these organisms are transmission vectors of the parasite.  A. cantonensis parasitizes humans as well and causes angiostrongyliasis.  P. manokwari is presumed to act as a transmission vector of the parasite to humans and affects the epidemiology of angiostrongyliasis.\nIn an outbreak of angiostrongyliasis in the Okinawa Prefecture, populations of Angiostrongylasis cantonensis intermediates were examined in order to find the most frequently infected intermediates.  P. manokwari was found to be one of the prevailing infected hosts, with an infection rate of 14.1%.  It is possible that Platydemus manokwari is a vector because it has been occasionally found underside cabbage leaves which would be eaten raw as fresh salad.\n\nPlatydemus manokwari has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical islands such as Micronesia, the Marquesas, the Society Islands, Samoa, Melanesia, and the Hawaiian Islands. These islands often harbor endemic radiations of rare and endangered snail species, which are a primary source of nutrition for Platydemus manokwari. Platydemus manokwari has also been introduced to several Japanese Islands.\nIn 2015, P. manokwari was found in Puerto Rico and in Florida, from which it could further invade the mainland southern US. In 2021, it was reported from the French islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint Martin in the Antilles. In 2023, it was reported in Brisbane, Australia, the southernmost location to this date.\n\nTwo haplotypes of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (a mitochondrial gene commonly used for DNA barcoding) sequence have been characterised for P. manokwari: one, named "World haplotype", has been found in France, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Singapore, Florida and Puerto Rico; and the other, named "Australian haplotype" was found in Australia. The only locality with both haplotypes was in the Solomon Islands. These results suggest that two haplotypes exist in the area of origin of the species, probably Papua New Guinea, but that only one of the two haplotypes (the "World haplotype") has, through human agency, been widely dispersed. The complete mitochondrial genome, 19,959-bp in length, was obtained in 2020; it contains 36 genes and is almost colinear with the mitogenomes of the two other species previously sampled from the Geoplanidae, Bipalium kewense and Obama nungara; however, the mitogenome of Platydemus manokwari has an unusually large Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene.', 'score': 965.32886}, {'id': 'Puccinia_violacea', 'name': ['Puccinia violacea'], 'introduction': '\n\nPhragmidium violaceum is a plant pathogen native to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. It primarily infects Rubus species.\n\nIt has been used in the biological control of invasive blackberry species in Chile, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2005, it was discovered growing on Himalayan blackberry plants in Oregon. This accidental introduction does not appear to be infecting native vegetation, so it offers hope for reducing the impact of invasive blackberries in the Pacific Northwest.', 'sections': 'The foliar symptoms that can be found include purple leaf spots along with yellow and tan centers. These can be found on the upper surface of the leaf and can resemble Septoria leaf spot. On the lower surface of the leaf yellow to orange pustules will be surrounded by a purple tinge. These can resemble cane and leaf rust. The leaves that are severely infected can start to dehydrate as well as start to curl. The leaves that are older and closer to the cane will get infected first and can die as well. The flowers and the fruits that are infected may fail to ripen. Stem infections as well as the continuous defoliation may cause the dieback of the canes. During the summer and fall the infected leaves can start to develop black pustules otherwise known as telia among the uredinia.\n\nThe pathogen is a macrocyclic, autoecious rust fungus, and produces five different spore states that represent the asexual and sexual components of the life cycle. Dikaryotic urediniospores are released during the summer as well as the spring while teliospores represent the overwintering stage. When the sexual outcrossing occurs the dikaryotic aeciospores and urediniospores are initiated. The teliospores in the spring will then undergo meiosis in order to produce haploid basidiospores. This follows the insect-mediated transfer of spermatia from the spermogonia of the different types of mating to the receptive hyphae. The spores are spread very easily and can be spread by wind.\n\nCultural tactics along with dormant season lime sulfur can help to reduce the initial inoculums source. The chemical tactics function to protect the healthy younger plant tissues. By removing the old fruiting canes early, after the harvest it will prevent the spreading of the infection. Chemical controls can be effective as well. Chemical protection will need to start by applying lime sulfur to the leaves that are infected. Fungicide application during fall, in the month of September, is the most beneficial for the health of the plant. There may be development of fungal resistance if there is overuse of any single product. The fungicides are primarily protectants therefore, cannot eradicate the disease after it becomes established. The biological control works when an uncharacterized population and or a mixture of strains of a pathogen from the native range of the target weed is released in the area into which the weed is introduced. The strain F15 was released as a biological control agent in 1991 and 1992. The release of the additional strains can originate the potential to increase the genetic diversity of the population of P. violaceum. The occurrence through recombination or the increase in the effective population size can in turn improve the impact of the biological control agent. Biological control agent is likely to be successful, however there is a high potential for the failure of additional strains due to the amount of inoculums involved in the pathogen strain recruitment. The amount of inoculums released is small when compared with the well-adapted pathogen that exists in the population', 'kingdom': 'Fungi', 'score': 955.82446}, {'id': 'Actias_luna', 'name': ['Actias luna'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe luna moth (Actias luna), also called the American moon moth, is a Nearctic moth in the family Saturniidae, subfamily Saturniinae, a group commonly named the giant silk moths.\n\nThe moth has lime-green wings and a white body. Its caterpillars are also green. Its typical wingspan is roughly 114\xa0mm (4.5\xa0in), but wingspans can exceed 178\xa0mm (7.0\xa0in), ranking the species as one of the larger moths in North America.\n\nAcross Canada, it has one generation per year, with the winged adults appearing in late May or early June, whereas farther south it will have two or even three generations per year, the first appearance as early as March in southern parts of the United States.\n\nAs defense mechanisms, larvae emit clicks as a warning and can also regurgitate intestinal contents, confirmed as having a deterrent effect on a variety of predators. The elongated tails of the hindwings are thought to confuse the echolocation detection used by predatory bats.\n\nA parasitoid fly deliberately introduced to North America as a biological pest control for the invasive species spongy moth (formerly known as gypsy moth) appears to have had a negative impact on luna moths and other native moths.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'Eggs, attached in small groups to undersides of leaves, are mottled white and brown, slightly oval, and roughly 1.5 millimeters in diameter. Larvae are primarily green, with sparse hairs. The first instar, emerging from the egg, reaches a length of 6–8\xa0mm (0.24–0.31\xa0in), the second 9–10\xa0mm (0.35–0.39\xa0in), the third 12–16\xa0mm (0.47–0.63\xa0in) and the fourth 23–26\xa0mm (0.91–1.02\xa0in). The fifth (final) instar grows to approximately 70–90\xa0mm (2.8–3.5\xa0in) in length. Small, colorful dots – yellow or magenta – may line the sides of the fourth and fifth instars. The larvae may take on a reddish-brown color just prior to cocooning. Fifth-instar larvae descend to the ground and use silk to bind dead leaves around the cocoon.\n\nThe imagoes (winged, sexually mature), often referred to as \'adult moths,\' emerge from the pupae with the wings small, crumpled and held close to the body. Over a period of several hours the wings will enlarge to full size. Wingspan is typically 8–11.5\xa0cm (3.1–4.5\xa0in), and in rare instances as much as 17.78\xa0cm (7.00\xa0in). Females and males are similar in size and appearance: green wings, eyespots on both forewings and hind wings, and long, sometimes somewhat twisted tails extending from the back edge of the hindwings. Bodies are white and hairy. Adults have vestigial mouthparts and do not feed. Energy is from fat stores created while a caterpillar. The forward edge of the forewing is dark-colored and thick, tapering in thickness from the thorax to the wing tip. Its color can range from maroon to brown. The eyespots, one per wing, are oval in shape on the forewings and round on the hindwings. Each eyespot can have arcs of black, blue, red, yellow, green or white. The eyespots are thought to confuse potential predators.\n\nThere are some sex-determined and regional differences in appearance. Females will have a larger abdomen compared to males because it contains 200–400 eggs. Both sexes have antennae, but on the male, much longer and wider. Wing color is blue-green in the north and for the overwintering generation in the central and southern states; second and third generation wing color has more of a yellow-green tint.\n\nDescribed and named Phalena plumata caudata by James Petiver in 1700, this was the first North American saturniid to be reported in the insect literature. The initial Latin name, which roughly translates to "brilliant, feather tail", was replaced when Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1758 in the tenth edition of Systema Naturae, and renamed it Phalaena luna, later Actias luna, with luna derived from Luna, the Roman moon goddess. The common name became "Luna moth". Several other North American giant silk moths were also given species names after Roman or Greek mythology.\n\nThe Luna moth is found in North America, from east of the Great Plains in the United States – Florida to Maine, and from Saskatchewan eastward through central Quebec to Nova Scotia in Canada. Luna moths are also rarely found in Western Europe as vagrants.\n\nBased on the climate in which they live, Luna moths produce different numbers of generations per year. In Canada and northern regions of the United States they are univoltine, meaning one generation per year. Life stages are approximately 10 days as eggs, 6–7 weeks as larvae, 2–3 weeks as pupae, finishing with one week as winged adults appearing in late May or early June. In the mid-Atlantic states the species is bivoltine, and farther south trivoltine, meaning respectively two and three generations per year. In the central states the first generation appears in April, second in July. Even farther south, first generation appears as early as March, with second and third spaced eight to ten weeks later.\n\nFemales lay 200–400 eggs, singly or in small groups, on the underside of leaves of the tree species preferred by the larvae. Egg laying starts the evening after mating is completed and goes on for several days. Eggs hatch in about a week.\n\nEach instar – the period between molts – generally takes about 4–10 days. There are five instars before cocooning. At the end of each instar, a small amount of silk is placed on the major vein of a leaf and the larva undergoes apolysis, then ecdysis (molting), leaving the old exoskeleton behind. Sometimes the shed exoskeleton is eaten. Newly hatched, this caterpillar constantly munches on the leaves of walnut, hickory, sweetgum, and paper birch trees. Each instar is green, though the first two instars do have some variation in which some larvae will have black underlying splotches on their dorsal side. The final instar grows to approximately 70 to 90\xa0mm (2.8 to 3.5\xa0in) in length. All five instar stages possess green spines on the dorsal surface. These spines do not sting, but can still cause irritation upon contact. This is a tree-dwelling species. Larvae stay on the same tree where they hatched until it is time to descend to the ground to make a cocoon. When females emerge from cocoons they fly to preferred tree species, emit pheromones, and wait there for males to find them. Although some larvae in the family Saturniidae are known to be poisonous, those of A. luna are not. The spines, or setae, located on the thoracic and abdominal segments have no chemical component to them.\n\nThe Luna moth pupates after spinning a silk cocoon, which is thin and single layered. Shortly before pupation, the final, fifth-instar caterpillar will engage in a "gut dump" where any excess water and intestinal contents are expelled. As pupae, this species is more physically active than most moths. When disturbed, the moths will wiggle within their pupal cases, producing a noise. Pupation takes approximately two weeks unless the individual is in diapause over winter, in which case the pupal stage takes about nine months. The mechanisms triggering diapause are generally a mixture of genetic triggers, duration of sunlight and temperature. The pupae have chitinous spurs near the base of the forewings. By vigorously moving about within the cocoon, these spurs tear a circular opening from which the imago emerges, the silk of the cocoon having also been weakened by the secretion of cocoonase, a protein-digesting enzyme.\n\nPupae transition to winged state after receiving external signals in the form of temperature change. When the adult Luna moths emerge from their pupae, their abdomens are swollen and their wings are small, soft and wet. The first few hours of adult life will be spent pumping hemolymph (invertebrates\' equivalent to blood) from the abdomen into the wings. The moths must wait for the wings to dry and harden before being able to fly. This process can take 2–3\xa0hours to complete. Luna moths are not rare, but are rarely seen due to their very brief (7–10 day) adult lives and nocturnal flying time. As with all giant silk moths, the adults only have vestigial mouthparts and no digestive system and therefore do not eat in their adult form, instead relying on energy they stored up as caterpillars. In regions where there are two or three generations per year, the second and third may have wing coloration that is more of a yellow-green compared to the first generation of the year.\n\nGiant silk moths have in common a mating process wherein the females, at night, release volatile sex pheromones, which the males, flying, detect via their large antennae. Males can detect these molecules at a distance of several miles, and then fly in the direction the wind is coming from until reaching the female. Luna moth females mate with the first males to find them, a process that typically starts after midnight and takes several hours. Researchers extracted three chemical compounds from the pheromone gland of unmated Luna moth females and identified one major and two minor aldehyde compounds designated E6,Z11-18:Ald, E6-18:Ald and Z11-18:Ald. The same compounds were also synthesized. Field experiments with both unmated females and the synthesized compounds confirmed that E6, Z11-18:Ald was the major sex pheromone, attraction augmented by the addition of E6-18:Ald but not by Z11-18:Ald. The authors mentioned that no other moth species were attracted to either the unmated females or the synthesized products, confirming that the pheromone is species-specific, at least for the sites and dates where it was tested.\n\nSome species of giant silk moth larvae are known to make clicking noises when attacked by rubbing their serrated mandibles together. These clicks are audible to humans and extend into ultrasound frequencies audible to predators. Clicks are thought to be a form of aposematic warning signaling, made prior to predator-deterring regurgitation of intestinal contents. Luna moth larvae click and regurgitate, with the regurgitated material confirmed as being a predator deterrent against several species.\n\nImagos (winged adults) of this and related night-flying Actias species collectively referred to as "moon moths" have long hindwing tails. A "false target" hypothesis holds that the tails evolved as a means of reducing risk of predation by bats which use echolocation to locate prey. The moths use the spinning hindwing tails to fool bats into attacking nonessential appendages, with success occurring over 55% of the time. Experiments were conducted with Luna moths with intact wings and with the tails removed. With intact wings, a majority of the attacking bats contacted the hindwing tails rather than the body of the moth; only 35% of intact moths were caught versus 81% for those with clipped tails. The results of this experiment support echolocation distortion as an effective countermeasure.\n\nThe parasitoid fly Compsilura concinnata native to Europe was deliberately introduced to the United States throughout much of the 20th century as a biological control for spongy moths. Due to its flexible life cycle, it can parasitize more than 150 species of butterflies and moths in North America. Researchers reported that when Luna moth larvae were placed outside for about a week and then collected and returned to the laboratory, four parasitic species emerged, the most common being C. concinnata. The researchers concluded that this parasitoid fly causes collateral damage to Luna moth populations.\n\nLuna moth larvae have displayed defenses against predators in late instars by developing spines once they reach about 3\xa0cm in length. Unlike other species such as Automeris io, which have chemical defenses much earlier in the larval stage, the Luna moth larvae are left largely defenseless until it reaches this length. However, the absence of a chemical defense allows for the shortening of the larval stage. Automeris io has a larval stage at least twice as long on average as Actias luna, leaving it vulnerable to parasitism.\n\nThe larvae of Luna moths feed on several different species of broadleaf trees. The larvae do not reach population densities sufficient to cause significant damage to their host trees. Tuskes listed white birch (Betula papyrifera), American persimmon (Diospyros virginiana) American sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), plus several species of hickory (Carya), walnut (Juglans) and sumac (Rhus) as host plants for the caterpillars. Other tree species have been identified as suitable for Actias luna larvae, but a feeding experiment that also included black cherry, eastern cottonwood, quaking aspen, white willow, red oak, white oak and tulip tree reported very poor survival on these seven tree species even though older literature had identified them as hosts. The author suggested that host plant utilization may differ regionally, so that larvae collected from one region may not tolerate host plants readily consumed in another region. Biochemical detoxification of host plant defensive chemicals by digestive system enzymes may be a factor in regional host plant specialization. Juglone is a chemical compound common to walnut and hickory which most insects find a deterrent or even toxic. Luna moth larvae have higher concentrations of juglone-neutralizing digestive system enzymes compared to other lepidoptera, and concentrations were even higher when larvae were fed walnut or hickory leaves versus white birch or American sweet gum. This suggests evolutionary and inducible adaptations to allow consumption of certain host plants.\n\nThe Luna moth appeared on a first class United States postage stamp issued in June 1987. Although more than two dozen butterflies have been so honored, as of 2019 this is the only moth.', 'score': 948.6327}, {'id': 'Ehrlichia_ruminantium', 'name': ['Ehrlichia ruminantium'], 'introduction': '\n\nHeartwater (also known as cowdriosis, nintas, and ehrlichiosis) is a tick-borne rickettsial disease. The name is derived from the fact that fluid can collect around the heart or in the lungs of infected animals. It is caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium)—an intracellular Gram-negative coccal bacterium (also referred to as Rickettsia ruminantium). The disease is spread by various Amblyomma ticks, and has a large economic impact on cattle production in affected areas. There are four documented manifestations of the disease, these are acute, peracute, subacute, and a mild form known as heartwater fever. There are reports of zoonotic infections of humans by E. ruminantium, similar to other Ehrlichia species, such as those that cause human ehrlichiosis.', 'sections': 'Heartwater disease was first described in 1838 within the personal journal of Louis Trichardt, a Voortrekker in South Africa. In Trichardt\'s notes he recorded that a majority of the surrounding sheep died approximately three weeks after a large tick infestation was observed.\n\nIn an 1877 testimony to the Cape of Good Hope Commission on Diseases of Sheep and Goats livestock producer J. Webb testified that the appearance of ticks on his farm 8 or 9 years earlier corresponded with an onset of fatal disease in his livestock. Webb reported opening the chest of the victims and discovering the "heart bag" to be full of "water."\n\nHeartwater first reached the Caribbean islands in 1980.\n\nThe disease is common in sub-Saharan Africa, but can ultimately be found wherever Amblyomma ticks are present. Major areas of concern for the disease also include Madagascar, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Comoros Islands, and Sao Tomé. Heartwater has been observed on three of the Caribbean islands, Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, and Antigua.\n\nIn the Caribbean, at least, the cattle egret has been implicated in the spread of heartwater, since it colonized the islands in the 1950s.\n\nNearly all members of Bovidae are susceptible to this disease, but vary in their susceptibility, Zubu and Water buffalo appearing to be most resistant. The most susceptible species to heartwater appears to be the various goats. The South African buffalo, bleskbok, black wildebeest, helmeted guinea fowl, leopard tortoise and scrub hare are known to host heartwater without symptoms and act as a tick reservoir.\n\nIn laboratory experiments non-ruminants such as ferrets, laboratory mice, and four-striped grass mice have demonstrated susceptibility to the disease.\n\nClinical disease is more common in young animals and non-native breeds. The clinical signs of disease are caused by an increased vascular permeability and consequent oedema and hypovolemia.\n\nThe symptoms include neurological signs such as tremors and head pressing, respiratory signs such as coughing and nasal discharge, and systemic signs such as fever and loss of appetite. Physical examination may reveal petechiae of the mucous membranes, tachycardia, and muffled heart sounds. Heartwater can also cause reproductive and gastrointestinal disease. It is frequently fatal.\n\nOn post mortem examination, a light yellow transudate that coagulates on exposure to air is often found within the thorax, pericardium, and abdomen. Most fatal cases have the hydropericardium that gives the disease its common name. Pulmonary oedema and mucosal congestion are regularly seen along with frothy fluid in the airways and cut surfaces of the lungs. To definitively diagnose the disease, C. ruminantium must be demonstrated either in preparations of the hippocampus under Giemsa staining or by histopathology of brain or kidney.\n\nDuring the early stages of disease, animals may be treated with sulfonamides and tetracyclines. In advanced disease, prognosis is poor. Tetracyclines can also be used prophylactically when animals are introduced into an area endemic with heartwater. Ectoparasiticides, used as dips, can be used to reduce exposure the animals exposure to bont ticks. In areas endemic for heartwater, the use of dips against other ticks of domestic animals, such as Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) and Hyalomma species is likely, and this will usually contribute to control of vectors of E. ruminantium.\n\nA live blood vaccine is available for protection of young stock, but animals may require treatment for the disease  after vaccination. Several experimental vaccines are currently being developed, examples include attenuated, recombinant and multi-epitope DNA vaccines.\n\nDepending on the species of the animal the mortality rate of the disease may vary from 5% to 90%. Mortality rates appear to be the highest within the various sheep and goat species, but this is not always the case, as some sheep species such as the Afrikaner have mortality rates only reaching as high as 6%.\n\nHeartwater is notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture believes that an outbreak in the U.S could cost the livestock industry up to $762 million in losses annually. The tick that carries the disease is thought to be capable of being transported by migratory birds from the Caribbean to at least Florida. The U.S has prepared an in-depth response plan to mitigate damages and contain any detected spread.', 'score': 947.79486}, {'id': 'Bacterium_cichorii', 'name': ['Bacterium cichorii'], 'introduction': '\n\nCCUG 32776 \nCFBP 2101 \nCIP 106704 \nDSM 50259 \nICMP 5707 \nLMG 2162 \nNCPPB 943\n\nPseudomonas cichorii is a Gram-negative soil bacterium that is pathogenic to plants. It has a wide host range, and can have an important economical impact on lettuce, celery and chrysanthemum crops. P. cichorii was first isolated on endives (Cichorium endivia), from which it derives its name. It produces 6-aminopenicillanic acid. Based on 16S rRNA analysis, P. cichorii has been placed in the P. syringae group.', 'sections': "Pseudomonas cichorii is non-host specific as it does not infect just one host. Its host range includes lettuce, pepper, celery, coffee, wheat, basil and several other host plants. Symptoms of the causal agent vary depending on the host and the area of the plant infected. In general, Pseudomonas cichorii is seen to cause leaf blighting and spotting. The first appearance of symptoms involves a water soaked lesion that develops at the edge of the leaf, midvein or randomly across the leaf. These lesions progressively turn black or brown and may be surrounded by yellow halos. These lesions also often “coalesce and progress to severe leaf blight under favorable conditions for the bacterium.” When the infected leaves become dry, the spots often look brittle and crack.\n\nGenerally, Pseudomonas cichorii can only survive for short periods in soil, but colonies have been isolated following six months of burial in plant debris and soil. For P. cichorii to divide and colonize after overwintering, conditions must be highly favorable. There must be an ideal temperature (20-28°C) and sufficient moisture. In addition to overwintering in plant debris and soil, P. cichorii can be transmitted via seeds. After favorable conditions allow colonization of the pathogen, it can spread via rain, splashing, wind, movement of debris, insects and of course, via human agricultural practices. P. cichorii is an epiphyte, and can therefore survive on leaf surfaces until gaining entry into the host tissue. Entry into host tissue can be accomplished via wounds or natural openings such as stomata, epidermal hairs, or hydathodes. If conditions are favorable upon entry into the host tissue, P. cichorii can multiply rapidly. Large populations of Pseudomonas are known to release an array of phytotoxins, and this is the cause of the observed spotting symptoms on the leaf. After infection and asexual reproduction, P. cichorii can then spread to other leaves or plants. If the host plant dies or the leaf falls off, it may survive in this debris and repeat the disease cycle.[citation needed]\n\nPseudomonas cichorii grows in warm, wet and humid areas. It spreads by wind driven rain and survives and infects on wet leaf surfaces. The pathogen is often spread during sprinkler watering and overhead irrigation systems. Plants growing outside exposed to rain exhibit dark brown to black spots on their leaf surface. When the plants are exposed to a limited amount of water and moisture, they exhibit sunken in lesions on both the upper and lower leaf surface. These different spots and lesion types often aid in the identification of P. cichorii. Free moisture on the leaves are known to promote disease development and plant infection.\n\nLittle is known about the biochemical pathways of Pseudomonas cichorii, but linear lipoproteins are believed to contribute to virulence, motility, and biofilm formation. Additionally, hrp genes of Pseudomonas cichorii have been found to affect pathogenicity of an eggplant host, but not a lettuce host. These discoveries give an insight to potential phytotoxins and virulence factors, and also illustrate how large the knowledge gap is in our understanding of P. cichorii.[citation needed]\n\nTo best prevent the spread of Pseudomonas cichorii the first intervention is to regulate the free water and watering system of leaves. Overhead sprinklers and hose watering should be replaced with soil irrigation. Soil irrigation is useful because it prevents excess water accumulation on plant surfaces by watering the plant from the root system. Soil irrigation also limits the ability of the seed structures to grow and infect leaf surfaces. A second intervention is watering earlier in the day. Watering earlier in the day gives the leaves more time during the day to dry. A third intervention, is to minimize leaf splashing. This lessens the chance that the infected water will spread to another host. Sanitation is also important. Workers and those handling the infected leaves should wash their hands and keep infected plant material from uninfected areas. These infected cuttings and seedlings should not be planted or kept near uninfected fields as the pathogen is able to survive on the host's seeds. The disease can be managed with copper or bactericidal products, but is not always successful in preventing disease spread when conditions are wet.\n\nThe value of U.S. lettuce production was around $1.9 billion in 2015, tomato production was valued at $821 million in 2018, and celery production was valued at $314 million in 2017. Pseudomonas cichorii can cause minimal to complete loss of crop yield in these species and many more. The wide range of hosts and presence on every continent besides Antarctica has contributed to its notoriety in many greenhouses and agricultural fields across the world. P. cichorii is present throughout the world, and historically has had significant impacts on a wide range of crops. Examples include the devastating varnish spot of lettuce in California, brown stem of celery in Florida, and the newly discovered leaf spot of tomato in New Zealand.", 'score': 940.08374}, {'id': 'Eragrostis_lehmanniana', 'name': ['Eragrostis lehmanniana'], 'introduction': '\n\nEragrostis lehmanniana is a species of grass known by the common name Lehmann lovegrass. It is native to southern Africa. It is present elsewhere as an introduced species. It is well known as an invasive weed in some areas, such as Arizona in the United States.\n\nThis grass produces loose, open clumps of stems up to 61 to 80 centimetres (2.00 to 2.62\xa0ft) long, with some stems growing erect and some lying across the ground and rooting where nodes come in contact with the substrate. The leaves are up to 15 centimetres (5.9\xa0in) long. The inflorescence is a panicle up to 18 centimetres (7.1\xa0in) long by 8 centimetres (3.1\xa0in) wide, with branches appressed to the stems or held out at an angle. The spikelets are up to 1.4\xa0cm (0.55\xa0in) long and contain up to 14 flowers each. The grass may spread via stolons.\n\nIn its native African range this grass is common in several habitat types such as Acacia woodland and Kalahari grasslands and savanna. It has been introduced to North and South America. In 1930 the grass was introduced to Arizona in the United States to replace the native grasses that had been severely overgrazed by livestock. In the 1940s the grass was spreading and could be found growing in areas where it had not been planted. By 1980 the grass had been sown on over 100,000 acres but it failed to take hold in many regions, such as parts of Texas and New Mexico. In the desert grasslands and shrublands of southeastern Arizona, however, it did well, growing best in areas with sandy soils, rare freezes, and summer rainfall totals of about 15 to 22\xa0cm (5.9 to 8.7\xa0in). Much beyond these parameters it does not spread or fails to survive. In 1988 it was a major species on 347,000 acres of Arizona desert. In parts of the region, the native ecosystem has been replaced by velvet mesquite woodland with an understory dominated by Lehmann lovegrass. This species sometimes hybridizes with Eragrostis curvula ("weeping lovegrass").\n\nThe grass produces large monotypic stands that crowd out native grasses and reduce plant and animal diversity. It forms a soil seed bank that can withstand long dry periods, giving it an advantage over some native grasses. It has been shown to have a negative impact on other types of plants, such as Agave palmeri, a key component in the local ecosystem.', 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'score': 917.24005}, {'id': 'Varroa_destructor', 'name': ['Varroa destructor'], 'introduction': '\n\nVarroa destructor, the Varroa mite, is an external parasitic mite that attacks and feeds on honey bees and is one of the most damaging honey bee pests in the world. A significant mite infestation leads to the death of a honey bee colony, usually in the late autumn through early spring. Without management for Varroa mite, honey bee colonies typically collapse within 2 to 3 years in temperate climates.  These mites can infest Apis mellifera, the western honey bee, and Apis cerana, the Asian honey bee. Due to very similar physical characteristics, this species was thought to be the closely related Varroa jacobsoni prior to 2000, but they were found to be two separate species after DNA analysis.\n\nParasitism of bees by mites in the genus Varroa is called varroosis. The Varroa mite can reproduce only in a honey bee colony. It attaches to the body of the bee and weakens the bee. The species is a vector for at least five debilitating bee viruses, including RNA viruses such as the deformed wing virus (DWV). The Varroa mite is the parasite with possibly the most pronounced economic impact on the beekeeping industry and is one of multiple stress factors contributing to the higher levels of bee losses around the world. Varroa mite has also been implicated as one of the multiple causes of colony collapse disorder.\n\nManagement of this pest focuses on reducing mite numbers through monitoring to avoid significant hive losses or death. 3% of bees infested in a hive is considered an economic threshold where damage is high enough to warrant additional management. Miticides are available, though some are difficult to time correctly while avoiding harm to the hive, and resistance has occurred for others. Screened bottom boards on hives can be used for both monitoring and mite removal, and drone comb that mites prefer can be used as a trap to remove mites from the hive. Honey bee lines in breeding programs also show partial resistance to Varroa mite through increased hygienic behavior that is being incorporated as an additional management strategy.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'The adult female mite is reddish-brown in color, while the male is white. Varroa mites are flat, having a button shape. They are 1–1.8\xa0mm long and 1.5–2\xa0mm wide, and have eight legs. Varroa mites lack eyes. These mites have curved bodies that allow them to fit between the abdominal segments of adult bees.\n\nHost bee species can help differentiate mite species in the genus Varroa; both V. destructor and Varroa jacobsoni parasitize Apis cerana, the Asian honey bee, but the closely related mite species originally described as V. jacobsoni by Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans in 1904 does not attack Apis mellifera, the western honey bee, unlike V. destructor. Until 2000, V. destructor was thought to be V. jacobsoni and resulted in some mislabeling in the scientific literature. The two species cannot be easily distinguished with physical traits and have 99.7% similar genomes, so DNA analysis is required instead. Because the more virulent and damaging species V. destructor could not be distinguished at the time, most pre-2000 research on western honey bees that refers to V. jacobsoni was actually research on V. destructor.\n\nOther Varroa species V. underwoodi and V. rindereri can also parasitize honey bee species and can be distinguished from V. destructor and V. jacobsoni with slight differences in body size and setae characteristics, though each of the four species within the Varroa genus have similar physical characteristics. If a Varroa species is found on a western honey bee, it will typically be V. destructor except where V. underwoodi is present, such as in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe name "Varroa mite" is typically used as the common name for V. destructor after the species was considered separate from V. jacobsoni.\n\nVarroa mite has two distinct genetic strains from when it switched hosts from the Asian honey bee to the western honey bee: Korean and Japanese. The Korean strain that occurred in 1952 is now found worldwide in high frequencies, while the Japanese strain that started around 1957 occurs in similar areas at much lower frequencies. Varroa mite has low genetic diversity, which is typical for an invasive species undergoing a range or host expansion.\n\nVarroa mites originally only occurred in Asia on the Asian honey bee, but this species has been introduced to many other countries on several continents, resulting in disastrous infestations of European honey bees.\n\nIntroduction data prior to 2000 is unclear due to confusion with V.\xa0jacobsoni. By 2020, V.\xa0destructor was confirmed to be present throughout North America excluding Greenland, South America, most of Europe and Asia, and portions of Africa. The species was not present in Australia as well as Oman, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malawi. It was suspected to not be present in Sudan and Somalia. Mites were found in 2022 in New South Wales in Australia.\n\nFemale mites enter brood cells to lay eggs on the comb wall after the cell is capped. Eggs are approximately 0.2 to 0.3\xa0mm in diameter and cannot be seen without magnification. These eggs hatch into male and female protonymphs that are both transparent white. Immature mites can only feed on capped brood, so the life cycle cannot be completed during broodless periods. Protonymphs molt into deuteronymphs that more closely resemble the curved body of adults before they molt into adults. Development time from egg to adult is 6–7 days. Males will not leave brood cells and only mate with females present in the brood cell.\n\nAdult females can be found feeding both on brood and adult bees. After reaching the adult stage, females will leave the brood cell and enter a phoretic stage where mites attach to adult bees in order to disperse. Mites will feed on adult bees at this time and can be transmitted from bee to bee during this stage. Nurse bees are preferred hosts in order to be moved to new brood cells. Because the nurse bee spends more time around the drone brood (i.e., male bees) rather than the worker brood, many more drones are infected with the mites. These phoretic females can also be transmitted to other hives through bee contact or hive equipment transfer. The phoretic stage can last for 4.5–11 days during brood production periods or up to five to six months when no brood is present in winter months. Female mites have a life expectancy of 27 days when brood is present.\n\nAfter the phoretic stage, female mites leave the adult bee and enter brood cells with bee larvae. Drone cells are preferred over workers. These females are called foundress mites, and they bury themselves in brood food provided by worker bees before the cell is capped. Brood cell capping begins egg cell activation for a foundress mite while she emerges to feed on the larva. She will lay a single unfertilized egg after feeding to produce a male mite. After laying this egg, fertilized eggs to produce females are laid approximately once a day. Both the mother and nymphs will feed on the developing pupa. Unless multiple foundress mites are present in a cell, mating occurs between siblings when they reach the adult stage. Once females mate, they are unable to receive additional sperm. Varroa mite\'s genetic bottleneck is also likely due to its habit of sibling mating.\n\nAdult mites feed on both adult bees and bee larvae by sucking on the fat body, an insect organ that stores glycogen and triglycerides with tissue abundant under epidermis and the surrounding internal body cavity. As the fat body is crucial for many bodily functions such as hormone and energy regulation, immunity, and pesticide detoxification, the mite\'s consumption of the fat body weakens both the adult bee and the larva. Feeding on fat body cells significantly decreases the weight of both the immature and adult bee. Infested adult worker bees have a shorter lifespan than ordinary worker bees, and they furthermore tend to be absent from the colony far more than ordinary bees, which could be due to their reduced ability to navigate or regulate their energy for flight. Infested bees are more likely to wander into other hives and further increase spread. Bees will occasionally drift into other nearby hives, but this rate is higher for Varroa infested bees.\n\nAdult mites live and feed under the abdominal plates of adult bees primarily on the underside of the abdominal region on the left side of the bee. Adult mites are more often identified as present in the hive when on top of the adult bee on the thorax, but mites in this location are likely not feeding, but rather attempting to transfer to another bee.\n\nVarroa mites have been found on flowers visited by worker bees, which may be a means by which phoretic mites spread short distances when other bees, including from other hives, visit. They have also been found on larvae of some wasp species, such as Vespula vulgaris, and flower-feeding insects such as the bumblebee, Bombus pensylvanicus, the scarab beetle, Phanaeus vindex, and the flower-fly, Palpada vinetorum. There have not been any indications Varroa mites are able to complete their life cycle on these insects, but instead they become distributed to other areas while a mite is still alive on these insects.\n\nOpen wounds left by the feeding become sites for disease and virus infections. The mites are vectors for at least five and possibly up to 18 debilitating bee viruses, including RNA viruses such as the deformed wing virus.\n\nPrior to the widespread introduction of Varroa mite, honey bee viruses were typically considered a minor issue. Virus particles are directly injected into the bee\'s body cavity and mites can also cause immunosuppression that increases infection in host bees. Varroa mites can transmit the following viruses:\n\nDeformed wing virus is one of the most prominent and damaging honey bee viruses transmitted by Varroa mites. It causes crumpled deformed wings that resemble sticks and also causes shortened abdomens.\n\nThere is some evidence that harm from both Varroa mite and associated viruses they transmit may be a contributing factor that leads to colony collapse disorder (CCD). While the exact causes of CCD are not known, infection of colonies from multiple pathogens and interaction of those pathogens with environmental stresses is considered by entomologists to be one of the likely causes of CCD. Most scientists agree there is not a single cause of CCD.\n\nMite populations undergo exponential growth when bee broods are available, and exponential decline when no brood is available. In 12 weeks, the number of mites in a western honey bee hive can multiply by roughly 12. Mites often invade colonies in the summer, leading to high mite populations in autumn. High mite populations in the autumn can cause a crisis when drone rearing ceases and the mites switch to worker larvae, causing a quick population crash and often hive death. Various management methods are used for Varroa mite integrated pest management to monitor and manage damage to hives.\n\nBeekeepers use several methods for monitoring levels of Varroa mites in a colony. They involve either estimating the total number of mites in a hive by using a sticky board under a screen bottom board to capture mites falling from the hive or estimating the number of mites per bee with powdered sugar or an ethanol wash.\n\nMonitoring for mites with a sticky board can be used to estimate the total number of mites in a colony over 72 hours using the equation:\n\nwhere b is the number of mites found on the sticky board and c is the number of estimated mites in the colony. However, the bee population in a colony also needs to be known to determine what population of mites is tolerable with this method.\n\nMite counts from a known quantity of bees (i.e., 300 bees) collected from brood comb are instead often used to determine mite severity. Mites are dislodged from a sample of bees using non-lethal or lethal means. The bees are shaken in a container of either powdered sugar, alcohol, or soapy water to dislodge and count mites. Powdered sugar is generally considered non-lethal to honey bees, but lethal methods such as alcohol can be more effective at dislodging mites. 3% of the colony being infested is considered an economic threshold damaging enough to warrant further management such as miticides, though beekeepers may use other management tactics in the 0–2% infestation range to keep mite populations low.\n\nVarroa mites can be treated with commercially available acaricides that must be timed carefully to minimize the contamination of honey that might be consumed by humans. The four most common synthetic pesticides used for mite treatments with formulations specific for honey bee colony use are amitraz, coumaphos, and two pyrethroids, flumethrin and tau-fluvalinate, while naturally occurring compounds include formic acid, oxalic acid, essential oils such as thymol and beta acids from hops resin (e.g. lupulone). Many of these products whether synthetic or naturally produced can negatively affect honey bee brood or queens. These products often are applied through impregnated plastic strips or as powders spread between brood frames.\n\nSynthetic compounds often have high efficacy against Varroa mites, but resistance has occurred for all of these products in different areas of the world. Pyrethroids are used because a concentration that will kill mites has relatively low toxicity to honey bees. Compounds derived from plants have also been assessed for mite management. Thymol is one essential oil with efficacy against mites, but can be harmful to bees at high temperatures. Other essential oils such as garlic, oregano, and neem oil have had some efficacy in field trials, though most essential oils that have been tested have little to no effect. Essential oil use is widespread in hives with many of those uses being off-label or in violation of pesticide regulations in various countries. Hop beta acids are lupulones obtained from hop plants and have been used in products marketed for mite control.\n\nResistance to pyrethroids has occurred in the Czech Republic and the UK due to a single amino acid substitution on Varroa mite\'s genome. Underlying mechanisms for resistance in other pesticides, such as coumaphos, are still unknown.\n\nVarroa mites can also be controlled through nonchemical means. Most of these controls are intended to reduce the mite population to a manageable level, not to eliminate the mites completely.\n\nScreened bottom boards are used both for monitoring and can modestly reduce mite populations by 11–14%. Mites which fall from the comb or bees can land outside the hive instead landing on a solid bottom board that would allow them to easily return to the nest.\n\nVarroa infest drone cells at a higher rate than worker brood cells, so drone cells can be used as a trap for mite removal. Beekeepers can also introduce a frame with drone foundation cells that encourage bees to construct more drone cells. When the drone cells are capped, the frame can be removed to freeze out mites. This labor-intensive process can reduce mite levels by about 50–93%, but if trap cells are not removed early enough before mites emerge, mite populations can spike. This method is only viable in spring and early summer when drones are produced.\n\nHeat is also sometimes used as a control method. The mites cannot survive temperatures near 40\xa0°C (104\xa0°F), but brief exposure to these temperatures do not harm honey bees. Devices are marketed intended to heat brood to these temperatures, though the efficacy of many of these products has not been reviewed.\n\nPowdered sugar used for estimating mite counts in hives has also been considered for mite management as it or other inert dusts were believed to initiate grooming responses. Long-term studies do not show any efficacy for reducing mite populations.\n\nThe Asian honey bee, is more hygienic with respect to Varroa mite than western honey bees, which is in part why mite infestations are more pronounced in western honey bee colonies. Efforts also have been made to breed hygienic honey bees heritable behavior traits, such as those with resistance to Varroa mites. Honey bee lines with resistance include Minnesota Hygienic Bees, Russian Honey Bees, and Varroa sensitive hygiene.\n\nHygienic behaviors include  workers removing pupae heavily infested with mites, which kills both the developing bee and immature mites, and grooming or removal from the brood cell, which increases adult mite mortality.  Mites removed from host pupae are at an incorrect life stage to re-infest another pupa.  An extended phoretic period in adult female mites has also been noticed.\n\nHygienic behavior is effective against diseases such as American foulbrood or chalkbrood, but the efficacy of this behavior against mites is not well-quantified; colonies with this behavior alone do not necessarily result in Varroa mite resistant colonies that can survive without miticide treatments. The efficacy of this behavior can vary between bee lines in comparison studies with Minnesota hygienic bees removing 66% of infested pupae, while Varroa sensitive hygiene bees removed 85% of infested pupae. There are minimal trade-off costs to hives that have this hygienic behavior, so it is being actively pursued in bee breeding programs.\n\nResearchers have been able to use RNA interference by feeding honey bees mixtures of double-stranded RNA that target expression of several Varroa mite genes, such as cytoskeleton arrangement, transfer of energy, and transcription. This can reduce infestation to 50% without harm to honey bees and is being pursued as an additional control method for Varroa mite.', 'score': 915.74524}, {'id': 'Ammophila_(Poaceae)', 'name': ['Ammophila (Poaceae)'], 'introduction': '\n\nAmmophila (synonymous with Psamma P. Beauv.) is a genus of flowering plants consisting of two or three very similar species of grasses. The common names for these grasses include marram grass, bent grass, and beachgrass. These grasses are found almost exclusively on the first line of coastal dunes. Their extensive systems of creeping underground stems or rhizomes allow them to thrive under conditions of shifting sands and high winds, and to help stabilize and prevent coastal erosion. Ammophila species are native to the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean where they are usually the dominant species on dunes. Their native range includes few inland regions, with the Great Lakes of North America being the main exception. The genus name Ammophila originates from the Greek words ἄμμος (ámmos), meaning "sand", and φίλος (philos), meaning "friend".\n\nThe Ammophila grasses are widely known as examples of xerophytes, plants that can withstand dry conditions. Despite their occurrence on seacoasts, Ammophila grasses are not particularly tolerant of saline soils; they can tolerate a salinity of about 15\xa0g/L (1.5%), which makes them "moderate halophytes".\n\nAmmophila builds coastal dunes and thus stabilizes the sand. For this reason, the plants are seen as a useful means of reinforcing dunes around the world and have been introduced far from their native range. Alfred Wiedemann writes that Ammophila arenaria, the European species, "has been introduced into virtually every British colonial settlement within its latitudinal tolerance range, including southeast and southwest Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Falkland Islands, and Norfolk Island and has been reported from Argentina and Chile." Ammophila species were introduced in the late 19th century on the Pacific coast of North America as well, and massive, intentional plantings were continued at least through 1960.\n\nIn essentially all of the locations where they have been introduced, Ammophila plants are now listed as invasive. Ammophila infestations largely impact coastal groundbirds and endemic dune plants, such as the Western Snowy plover, Streaked Horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata), and pink sand verbena (Abronia. umbellata ssp. breviflora). In California, efforts to cull invasive Ammophila arenaria from Morro Strand State Beach began in 2000 and involved a combination of herbicide treatments and handpulling by a California Conservation Corps crew. This initiative produced 60 percent mortality among the Ammophila after several months, but it was estimated that several additional rounds of treatment would be needed to fully remove the infestation, and the effort specifically focused on "relatively new infestations." Bulldozing has also been used as an effective mechanical treatment for Ammophila infestations in the Pacific Northwest, but research indicates that the intensity and frequency of bulldozing employed to remove Ammophila may also harm endemic dune plants and have negative impacts on dune geomorphology.', 'sections': 'Only two species seem incontrovertible: A.\xa0arenaria and A.\xa0breviligulata. Two other species have been proposed, and are discussed below.\n\nIn Europe, Ammophila arenaria has a coastal distribution and is the dominant species on dunes where it is responsible for stabilising and building the foredune by capturing blown sand and binding it together with the warp and weft of its tough, fibrous rhizome system.  Marram grass is strongly associated with two coastal plant community types in the British National Vegetation Classification. In community SD6 (Mobile Dune) Ammophila is the dominant species. In the semi-fixed dunes (community SD7), where the quantity of blown sand is declining Ammophila becomes less competitive, and other species, notably  Festuca rubra (red fescue) become prominent.\n\nThe ability of marram grass to grow on and bind sand makes it a useful plant in the stabilization of coastal dunes and artificial defences on sandy coasts. The usefulness was recognized in the late 18th century. On the North Sea coast of Jutland,\nDenmark, marram grass was traditionally much used for fuel, thatch, cattle fodder (after frost) etc. The use led to sand drift and loss of arable land. Hence, legislation promoting dune stabilization came into force in 1779 and 1792, successively leading to a system of state-supported dune planters overlooked by dune bailiffs. Marram grass was – and still is – propagated by root and shoot cuttings dug up locally and planted into the naked sand in periods of relatively calm and moist weather.\n\nWomen from the village of Newborough, Anglesey, Wales once used marram grass in the manufacture of mats, haystack covers and brushes for whitewashing.\n\nMarram grass has been widely used for thatch in many areas of the British Isles close to the sea. The harvesting of marram grass for thatch was so widespread during the 17th century that it had the effect of destabilizing dunes, resulting in the burial of many villages, estates and farms. In 1695 the practice was banned by an Act of the Scottish Parliament:\n\nConsidering that many lands, meadowes and pasturages lying on sea coasts have been ruined and overspread in many places in this kingdom by sand driven from adjacent sand hills ... His Majesty does strictly prohibit and discharge the pulling of bent, broom or juniper off the sand hills for hereafter.\n\nLike other xerophytes, marram grass is well adapted to its surroundings to thrive in an otherwise harsh environment. The natural loss of water through transpiration is not desirable in a very dry landscape, and marram grass has developed particular adaptations to help it deal with this. Sandy conditions drain water quickly, and very windy conditions will further increase rates of transpiration.\n\nMarram grass has a rolled leaf that creates a localized environment of water vapour concentration within the leaf and helps to prevent water loss. The stomata sit in small pits within the curls of the structure, which makes them less likely to open and lose water. The folded leaves have hairs on the inside to slow or stop air movement, much like many other xerophytes (though these are typically found on the outside of the plant,in marram grass they are also within the leaf as this has now become a structure with more volume). This slowing of air movement once again reduces the amount of water vapour being lost. A waxy cuticle on the leaf surface also prevents evaporation.', 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'score': 913.01636}, {'id': 'Alistipes', 'name': ['Alistipes'], 'introduction': '\n\nAlistipes is a Gram-negative genus of rod-shaped anaerobic bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidota. When members of this genus colonize the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, they provide protective effects against colitis (intestinal inflammation), and cirrhosis (liver fibrosis) [citations needed]. However, this genus can also cause dysbiosis by contributing to anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and hypertension. Showcasing priority effects in microbiome assembly, when infant GI tracts have bacteria of the species Staphylococcus but not the species Faecalibacterium, Alistipes species become less capable of colonization. Alistipes, typically benign in the gut, can sometimes trigger infections like intra-abdominal abscesses and bloodstream infections, emphasizing the fine line between symbiosis and disease. This underscores the significance of comprehending their impact on human health within microbial ecosystems.\n\n\n\n', 'sections': 'Alistipes is derived from the Neo-Latin noun alistipes, meaning "the other stick", which is further derived from the Latin adjective alius (other) and noun stipes (log/post).\n\nThis genus has eleven validly published species, as per the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP):', 'score': 912.8041}, {'id': 'Salmonella', 'name': ['Salmonella'], 'introduction': '\n\nSalmonella is a genus of rod-shaped, (bacillus) gram-negative bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The two known species of Salmonella are Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori. S.\xa0enterica is the type species and is further divided into six subspecies that include over 2,650 serotypes. Salmonella was named after Daniel Elmer Salmon (1850–1914), an American veterinary surgeon.\n\nSalmonella species are non-spore-forming, predominantly motile enterobacteria with cell diameters between about 0.7 and 1.5\xa0μm, lengths from 2 to 5\xa0μm, and peritrichous flagella (all around the cell body, allowing them to move). They are chemotrophs, obtaining their energy from oxidation and reduction reactions, using organic sources. They are also facultative anaerobes, capable of generating adenosine triphosphate with oxygen ("aerobically") when it is available, or using other electron acceptors or fermentation ("anaerobically") when oxygen is not available.\n\nSalmonella species are intracellular pathogens, of which certain serotypes cause illness such as salmonellosis. Most infections are due to the ingestion of food contaminated by feces. Typhoidal Salmonella serotypes can only be transferred between humans and can cause foodborne illness as well as typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Typhoid fever is caused by typhoidal Salmonella invading the bloodstream, as well as spreading throughout the body, invading organs, and secreting endotoxins (the septic form). This can lead to life-threatening hypovolemic shock and septic shock, and requires intensive care,  including antibiotics.\n\nNontyphoidal Salmonella serotypes are zoonotic and can be transferred from animals and between humans. They usually invade only the gastrointestinal tract and cause salmonellosis, the symptoms of which can be resolved without antibiotics. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, nontyphoidal Salmonella can be invasive and cause paratyphoid fever, which requires immediate antibiotic treatment.', 'sections': 'The genus Salmonella is part of the family of Enterobacteriaceae. Its taxonomy has been revised and has the potential to confuse. The genus comprises two species, S. bongori and S. enterica, the latter of which is divided into six subspecies: S. e. enterica, S. e. salamae, S. e. arizonae, S. e. diarizonae, S. e. houtenae, and S. e. indica. The taxonomic group contains more than 2500 serotypes (also serovars) defined on the basis of the somatic O (lipopolysaccharide) and flagellar H antigens (the Kauffman–White classification). The full name of a serotype is given as, for example, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium, but can be abbreviated to Salmonella Typhimurium. Further differentiation of strains to assist clinical and epidemiological investigation may be achieved by antibiotic sensitivity testing and by other molecular biology techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and, increasingly, whole genome sequencing. Historically, salmonellae have been clinically categorized as invasive (typhoidal) or non-invasive (nontyphoidal salmonellae) based on host preference and disease manifestations in humans.\n\nSalmonella was first visualized in 1880 by Karl Eberth in the Peyer\'s patches and spleens of typhoid patients. Four years later, Georg Theodor Gaffky was able to grow the pathogen in pure culture. A year after that, medical research scientist Theobald Smith discovered what would be later known as Salmonella enterica (var. Choleraesuis).  At the time, Smith was working as a research laboratory assistant in the Veterinary Division of the United States Department of Agriculture. The division was under the administration of Daniel Elmer Salmon, a veterinary pathologist.  Initially, Salmonella Choleraesuis was thought to be the causative agent of hog cholera, so Salmon and Smith named it "Hog-cholera bacillus".  The name Salmonella was not used until 1900, when Joseph Leon Lignières proposed that the pathogen discovered by Salmon\'s group be called Salmonella in his honor.:\u200a16\n\nIn the late 1930s, Australian bacteriologist Nancy Atkinson established a salmonella typing laboratory – one of only three in the world at the time – at the Government of South Australia\'s Laboratory of Pathology and Bacteriology in Adelaide (later the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science). It was here that Atkinson described multiple new strains of salmonella, including Salmonella Adelaide, which was isolated in 1943. Atkinson published her work on salmonellas in 1957.\n\nSerotyping is done by mixing cells with antibodies for a particular antigen. It can give some idea about risk. A 2014 study showed that S. Reading is very common among young turkey samples, but it is not a significant contributor to human salmonellosis. Serotyping can assist in identifying the source of contamination by matching serotypes in people with serotypes in the suspected source of infection.  Appropriate prophylactic treatment can be identified from the known antibiotic resistance of the serotype.\n\nNewer methods of "serotyping" include xMAP and real-time PCR, two methods based on DNA sequences instead of antibody reactions. These methods can be potentially faster, thanks to advances in sequencing technology. These "molecular serotyping" systems actually perform genotyping of the genes that determine surface antigens.\n\nMost subspecies of Salmonella produce hydrogen sulfide, which can readily be detected by growing them on media containing ferrous sulfate, such as is used in the triple sugar iron test. Most isolates exist in two phases, a motile phase and a non-motile phase. Cultures that are nonmotile upon primary culture may be switched to the motile phase using a Craigie tube or ditch plate. RVS broth can be used to enrich for Salmonella species for detection in a clinical sample.\n\nSalmonella can also be detected and subtyped using multiplex or real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from extracted Salmonella DNA.\n\nMathematical models of Salmonella growth kinetics have been developed for chicken, pork, tomatoes, and melons. Salmonella reproduce asexually with a cell division interval of 40 minutes.\n\nSalmonella species lead predominantly host-associated lifestyles, but the bacteria were found to be able to persist in a bathroom setting for weeks following contamination, and are frequently isolated from water sources, which act as bacterial reservoirs and may help to facilitate transmission between hosts. Salmonella is notorious for its ability to survive desiccation and can persist for years in dry environments and foods.\n\nThe bacteria are not destroyed by freezing, but UV light and heat accelerate their destruction. They perish after being heated to 55\xa0°C (131\xa0°F) for 90 min, or to 60\xa0°C (140\xa0°F) for 12 min, although if inoculated in high fat, high liquid substances like peanut butter, they gain heat resistance and can survive up to 90\xa0°C (194\xa0°F) for 30 min. To protect against Salmonella infection, heating food to an internal temperature of 75\xa0°C (167\xa0°F) is recommended.\n\nSalmonella species can be found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, especially reptiles. Salmonella on the skin of reptiles or amphibians can be passed to people who handle the animals. Food and water can also be contaminated with the bacteria if they come in contact with the feces of infected people or animals.\n\nInitially, each Salmonella "species" was named according to clinical consideration, for example Salmonella typhi-murium (mouse-typhoid), S. cholerae-suis (pig-cholera). After host specificity was recognized not to exist for many species, new strains received species names according to the location at which the new strain was isolated.\n\nIn 1987, Le Minor and Popoff used molecular findings to argue that Salmonella consisted of only one species, S. enterica, turning former "species" names into serotypes. In 1989, Reeves et al. proposed that the serotype V should remain its own species, resurrecting the name S. bongori. The current (by 2005) nomenclature has thus taken shape, with six recognised subspecies under S. enterica: enterica (serotype I), salamae (serotype II), arizonae (IIIa), diarizonae (IIIb), houtenae (IV), and indica (VI). As specialists in infectious disease are not familiar with the new nomenclature, the traditional nomenclature remains common.[citation needed]\n\nThe serotype or serovar is a classification of Salmonella based on antigens that the organism presents. The Kauffman–White classification scheme differentiates serological varieties from each other. Serotypes are usually put into subspecies groups after the genus and species, with the serotypes/serovars capitalized, but not italicized:  An example is Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. More modern approaches for typing and subtyping Salmonella include DNA-based methods such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multiple-loci VNTR analysis, multilocus sequence typing, and multiplex-PCR-based methods.\n\nIn 2005, a third species, Salmonella subterranea, was proposed, but according to the World Health Organization, the bacterium reported does not belong in the genus Salmonella. In 2016, S. subterranea was proposed to be assigned to Atlantibacter subterranea, but LPSN rejects it as an invalid publication, as it was made outside of IJSB and IJSEM. GTDB and NCBI agree with the 2016 reassignment.\n\nGTDB RS202 reports that S. arizonae, S. diarizonae, and S. houtenae should be species of their own.\n\nSalmonella species are facultative intracellular pathogens. Salmonella can invade different cell types, including epithelial cells, M cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. As facultative anaerobic organism, Salmonella uses oxygen to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in aerobic environments (i.e., when oxygen is available). However, in anaerobic environments (i.e., when oxygen is not available) Salmonella produces ATP by fermentation — that is, by substituting, instead of oxygen, at least one of four electron acceptors at the end of the electron transport chain: sulfate, nitrate, sulfur, or fumarate (all of which are less efficient than oxygen).\n\nMost infections are due to ingestion of food contaminated by animal feces, or by human feces (for example, from the hands of a food-service worker at a commercial eatery). Salmonella serotypes can be divided into two main groups—typhoidal and nontyphoidal. Typhoidal serotypes include Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A, which are adapted to humans and do not occur in other animals. Nontyphoidal serotypes are more common, and usually cause self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. They can infect a range of animals, and are zoonotic, meaning they can be transferred between humans and other animals.[citation needed]\n\nSalmonella pathogenicity and host interaction has been studied extensively since the 2010s. Most of the important virulent genes of Salmonella are encoded in five pathogenicity islands — the so-called Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs). These are chromosomal encoded and make a significant contribution to bacterial-host interaction. More traits, like plasmids, flagella or biofilm-related proteins, can contribute in the infection. SPIs are regulated by complex and fine-tuned regulatory networks that allow the gene expression only in the presence of the right environmental stresses.\n\nMolecular modeling and active site analysis of SdiA homolog, a putative quorum sensor for Salmonella typhimurium pathogenicity, reveals the specific binding patterns of AHL transcriptional regulators. It is also known that Salmonella plasmid virulence gene spvB enhances bacterial virulence by inhibiting autophagy.\n\nTyphoid fever is caused by Salmonella serotypes which are strictly adapted to humans or higher primates—these include Salmonella Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, and Paratyphi C. In the systemic form of the disease, salmonellae pass through the lymphatic system of the intestine into the blood of the patients (typhoid form) and are carried to various organs (liver, spleen, kidneys) to form secondary foci (septic form). Endotoxins first act on the vascular and nervous apparatus, resulting in increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, upset of thermal regulation, and vomiting and diarrhoea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and electrolytes are lost to upset the water-salt metabolism, decrease the circulating blood volume and arterial pressure, and cause hypovolemic shock. Septic shock may also develop. Shock of mixed character (with signs of both hypovolemic and septic shock) is more common in severe salmonellosis. Oliguria and azotemia may develop in severe cases as a result of renal involvement due to hypoxia and toxemia.[citation needed]\n\nInfection with nontyphoidal serotypes of Salmonella generally results in food poisoning. Infection usually occurs when a person ingests foods that contain a high concentration[clarification needed] of the bacteria. Infants and young children are much more susceptible to infection, easily achieved by ingesting a small number[clarification needed] of bacteria. In infants, infection through inhalation of bacteria-laden dust is possible.[citation needed]\n\nThe organisms enter through the digestive tract and must be ingested in large numbers to cause disease in healthy adults. An infection can only begin after living salmonellae (not merely Salmonella-produced toxins) reach the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the microorganisms are killed in the stomach, while the surviving ones enter the small intestine and multiply in tissues. Gastric acidity is responsible for the destruction of the majority of ingested bacteria, but Salmonella has evolved a degree of tolerance to acidic environments that allows a subset of ingested bacteria to survive. Bacterial colonies may also become trapped in mucus produced in the esophagus. By the end of the incubation period, the nearby host cells are poisoned by endotoxins released from the dead salmonellae. The local response to the endotoxins is enteritis and gastrointestinal disorder.[citation needed]\n\nAbout 2,000 serotypes of nontyphoidal Salmonella are known, which may be responsible for as many as 1.4\xa0million illnesses in the United States each year. People who are at risk for severe illness include infants, elderly, organ-transplant recipients, and the immunocompromised.\n\nWhile in developed countries, nontyphoidal serotypes present mostly as gastrointestinal disease, in sub-Saharan Africa, these serotypes can create a major problem in bloodstream infections, and are the most commonly isolated bacteria from the blood of those presenting with fever. Bloodstream infections caused by nontyphoidal salmonellae in Africa were reported in 2012 to have a case fatality rate of 20–25%. Most cases of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella infection (iNTS) are caused by Salmonella enterica Typhimurium or Salmonella enterica Enteritidis. A new form of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST313) emerged in the southeast of the African continent 75 years ago, followed by a second wave which came out of central Africa 18 years later. This second wave of iNTS possibly originated in the Congo Basin, and early in the event picked up a gene that made it resistant to the antibiotic chloramphenicol. This created the need to use expensive antimicrobial drugs in areas of Africa that were very poor, making treatment difficult. The increased prevalence of iNTS in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions is thought to be due to the large proportion of the African population with some degree of immune suppression or impairment due to the burden of HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, especially in children. The genetic makeup of iNTS is evolving into a more typhoid-like bacterium, able to efficiently spread around the human body. Symptoms are reported to be diverse, including fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and respiratory symptoms, often with an absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nDue to being considered sporadic, between 60% and 80% of salmonella infections cases go undiagnosed. In March 2010, data analysis was completed to estimate an incidence rate of 1140 per 100,000 person-years. In the same analysis, 93.8\xa0million cases of gastroenteritis were due to salmonella infections. At the 5th percentile the estimated amount was 61.8\xa0million cases and at the 95th percentile the estimated amount was 131.6\xa0million cases. The estimated number of deaths due to salmonella was approximately 155,000 deaths. In 2014, in countries such as Bulgaria and Portugal, children under 4 were 32 and 82 times more likely, respectively, to have a salmonella infection.  Those who are most susceptible to infection are: children, pregnant women, elderly people, and those with deficient immune systems.\n\nRisk factors for Salmonella infections include a variety of foods. Meats such as chicken and pork have the possibility to be contaminated. A variety of vegetables and sprouts may also have salmonella. Lastly, a variety of processed foods such as chicken nuggets and pot pies may also contain this bacteria.\n\nSuccessful forms of prevention come from existing entities such as the FDA, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Food Safety and Inspection Service. All of these organizations create standards and inspections to ensure public safety in the U.S. For example, the FSIS agency working with the USDA has a Salmonella Action Plan in place. Recently, it received a two-year plan update in February 2016. Their accomplishments and strategies to reduce Salmonella infection are presented in the plans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides valuable information on preventative care, such has how to safely handle raw foods, and the correct way to store these products. In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority created preventative measures through risk management and risk assessment. From 2005 to 2009, the EFSA placed an approach to reduce exposure to Salmonella. Their approach included risk assessment and risk management of poultry, which resulted in a reduction of infection cases by one half. In Latin America an orally administered vaccine for Salmonella in poultry developed by Dr. Sherry Layton has been introduced which prevents the bacteria from contaminating the birds.\n\nA recent Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak has been linked to chocolate produced in Belgium, leading to the country halting Kinder chocolate production.\n\n\n\nIn Germany, food-borne infections must be reported. From 1990 to 2016, the number of officially recorded cases decreased from about 200,000 to about 13,000 cases. In the United States, about 1,200,000 cases of Salmonella infection are estimated to occur each year. A World Health Organization study estimated that 21,650,974 cases of typhoid fever occurred in 2000, 216,510 of which resulted in death, along with 5,412,744 cases of paratyphoid fever.\n\nThe mechanisms of infection differ between typhoidal and nontyphoidal serotypes, owing to their different targets in the body and the different symptoms that they cause. Both groups must enter by crossing the barrier created by the intestinal cell wall, but once they have passed this barrier, they use different strategies to cause infection.[citation needed]\n\nWhile travelling to their target tissue in the gastrointestinal tract, Salmonella is exposed to stomach acid, to the detergent-like activity of bile in the intestine, to decreasing oxygen supply, to the competing normal gut flora, and finally to antimicrobial peptides present on the surface of the cells lining the intestinal wall. All of these form stresses that Salmonella can sense and reacts against, and they form virulence factors and as such regulate the switch from their normal growth in the intestine into virulence.\n\nThe switch to virulence gives access to a replication niche inside the host (such as humans), and can be summarised into several stages:[citation needed]\n\nNontyphoidal serotypes preferentially enter M cells on the intestinal wall by bacterial-mediated endocytosis, a process associated with intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea. They are also able to disrupt tight junctions between the cells of the intestinal wall, impairing the cells\' ability to stop the flow of ions, water, and immune cells into and out of the intestine. The combination of the inflammation caused by bacterial-mediated endocytosis and the disruption of tight junctions is thought to contribute significantly to the induction of diarrhoea.\n\nSalmonellae are also able to breach the intestinal barrier via phagocytosis and trafficking by CD18-positive immune cells, which may be a mechanism key to typhoidal Salmonella infection. This is thought to be a more stealthy way of passing the intestinal barrier, and may, therefore, contribute to the fact that lower numbers of typhoidal Salmonella are required for infection than nontyphoidal Salmonella. Salmonella cells are able to enter macrophages via macropinocytosis. Typhoidal serotypes can use this to achieve dissemination throughout the body via the mononuclear phagocyte system, a network of connective tissue that contains immune cells, and surrounds tissue associated with the immune system throughout the body.\n\nMuch of the success of Salmonella in causing infection is attributed to two type III secretion systems (T3SS) which are expressed at different times during the infection. The T3SS-1 enables the injection of bacterial effectors within the host cytosol. These T3SS-1 effectors stimulate the formation of membrane ruffles allowing the uptake of Salmonella by nonphagocytic cells. Salmonella further resides within a membrane-bound compartment called the Salmonella-Containing Vacuole (SCV). The acidification of the SCV leads to the expression of the T3SS-2. The secretion of T3SS-2 effectors by Salmonella is required for its efficient survival in the host cytosol and establishment of systemic disease. In addition, both T3SS are involved in the colonization of the intestine, induction of intestinal inflammatory responses and diarrhea. These systems contain many genes which must work cooperatively to achieve infection.[citation needed]\n\nThe AvrA toxin injected by the SPI1 type III secretion system of S. Typhimurium works to inhibit the innate immune system by virtue of its serine/threonine acetyltransferase activity, and requires binding to eukaryotic target cell phytic acid (IP6). This leaves the host more susceptible to infection.[citation needed]\n\nSalmonellosis is known to be able to cause back pain or spondylosis.  It can manifest as five clinical patterns: gastrointestinal tract infection, enteric fever, bacteremia, local infection, and the chronic reservoir state. The initial symptoms are nonspecific fever, weakness, and myalgia among others. In the bacteremia state, it can spread to any parts of the body and this induces localized infection or it forms abscesses. The forms of localized Salmonella infections are arthritis, urinary tract infection, infection of the central nervous system, bone infection, soft tissue infection, etc.  Infection may remain as the latent form for a long time, and when the function of reticular endothelial cells is deteriorated, it may become activated and consequently, it may secondarily induce spreading infection in the bone several months or several years after acute salmonellosis.\n\nA 2018 Imperial College London study also shows how salmonella disrupt specific arms of the immune system (e.g. 3 of 5 NF-kappaB proteins) using a family of zinc metalloproteinase effectors, leaving others untouched. Salmonella thyroid abscess has also been reported.\n\nA hallmark of Salmonella pathogenesis is the ability of the bacterium to survive and proliferate within phagocytes.  Phagocytes produce DNA-damaging agents such as nitric oxide and oxygen radicals as a defense against pathogens. Thus, Salmonella species must face attack by molecules that challenge genome integrity. Buchmeier et al. showed that mutants of S. enterica lacking RecA or RecBC protein function are highly sensitive to oxidative compounds synthesized by macrophages, and furthermore these findings indicate that successful systemic infection by S. enterica requires RecA- and RecBC-mediated recombinational repair of DNA damage.\n\nS. enterica, through some of its serotypes such as Typhimurium and Enteritidis, shows signs that it has the ability to infect several different mammalian host species, while other serotypes, such as Typhi, seem to be restricted to only a few hosts. Two ways that Salmonella serotypes have adapted to their hosts are by the loss of genetic material, and mutation. In more complex mammalian species, immune systems, which include pathogen specific immune responses, target serovars of Salmonella by binding antibodies to structures such as flagella. Thus  Salmonella that has lost the genetic material which codes for a flagellum to form can evade a host\'s immune system. mgtC leader RNA from bacteria virulence gene (mgtCBR operon) decreases flagellin production during infection by directly base pairing with mRNAs of the fljB gene encoding flagellin and promotes degradation. In the study by Kisela et al., more pathogenic serovars of S. enterica were found to have certain adhesins in common that have developed out of convergent evolution. This means that, as these strains of Salmonella have been exposed to similar conditions such as immune systems, similar structures evolved separately to negate these similar, more advanced defenses in hosts. Although many questions remain about how Salmonella has evolved into so many different types, Salmonella may have evolved through several phases. For example, as Baumler et al. have suggested, Salmonella most likely evolved through horizontal gene transfer, and through the formation of new serovars due to additional pathogenicity islands, and through an approximation of its ancestry. So, Salmonella could have evolved into its many different serotypes by gaining genetic information from different pathogenic bacteria. The presence of several pathogenicity islands in the genome of different serotypes has lent credence to this theory.\n\nSalmonella sv. Newport shows signs of adaptation to a plant-colonization lifestyle, which may play a role in its disproportionate association with food-borne illness linked to produce. A variety of functions selected for during sv. Newport persistence in tomatoes have been reported to be similar to those selected for in sv. Typhimurium from animal hosts. The papA gene, which is unique to sv. Newport, contributes to the strain\'s fitness in tomatoes, and has homologs in the genomes of other Enterobacteriaceae that are able to colonize plant and animal hosts.\n\nIn addition to their importance as pathogens, nontyphoidal Salmonella species such as S. enterica serovar Typhimurium are commonly used as homologues of typhoid species. Many findings are transferable and it attenuates the danger for the researcher in case of contamination, but is also limited. For example, it is not possible to study specific typhoidal toxins using this model. However, strong research tools such as the commonly-used mouse intestine gastroenteritis model build upon the use of Salmonella Typhimurium.\n\nFor genetics, S. Typhimurium has been instrumental in the development of genetic tools that led to an understanding of fundamental bacterial physiology. These developments were enabled by the discovery of the first generalized transducing phage P22 in S. Typhimurium, that allowed quick and easy genetic editing. In turn, this made fine structure genetic analysis possible. The large number of mutants led to a revision of genetic nomenclature for bacteria. Many of the uses of transposons as genetic tools, including transposon delivery, mutagenesis, and construction of chromosome rearrangements, were also developed in S. Typhimurium. These genetic tools also led to a simple test for carcinogens, the Ames test.\n\nAs a natural alternative to traditional antimicrobials, phages are being recognised as highly effective control agents for Salmonella and other foodborne bacteria.\n\nS. enterica genomes have been reconstructed from up to 6,500 year old human remains across Western Eurasia, which provides evidence for geographic widespread infections with systemic S. enterica during prehistory, and a possible role of the Neolithization process in the evolution of host adaptation. Additional reconstructed genomes from colonial Mexico suggest S. enterica as the cause of cocoliztli, an epidemic in 16th-century New Spain.', 'score': 911.89185}, {'id': 'Ptilinopus_huttoni', 'name': ['Ptilinopus huttoni'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe Rapa fruit dove (Ptilinopus huttoni) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae, which includes pigeons and doves. It is endemic to the island of Rapa Iti in French Polynesia. The species was classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List in 2018 because of its small population and predicted continued decline. The Rapa fruit dove primarily feeds on fleshy fruit. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and it has an extent of 30 km2. It is threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation and invasive species. Effective land protection and management could increase the quality of habitat for the species. Additional research into population dynamics and the impact of threats to the species can give a better understanding of the conservation practices needed.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "The Rapa fruit dove is approximately 31 centimeters tall, making it a medium-sized dove. It is a colorful bird, with mostly green plumage, especially on its wings. Its foreparts (head, neck, chest, upper back) have blue-gray plumage. It has a yellow lower belly with a rose-purple band below its chest feathers. A distinguishing feature of the Rapa fruit dove is its bright pink crown, located on the face between the eyes.\n\nThis species is endemic to the small island of Rapa Iti in the Austral Islands of French Polynesia and has an estimated extent of 30 km2. The population was estimated at 160 individuals in 2017, with all individuals in one subpopulation. Surveys carried out in 1989-1990 found a population of approximately 274, resulting in a 42% decline in population between the two surveys.\n\nThe Rapa fruit dove lives in the remaining undisturbed forest fragments on the island and prefers an elevation between 40 – 450 meters. Rapa Iti has a tropical climate and the dove can be found in the moist lowland forests. They prefer the most wooded areas but can occasionally be found in the Caribbean pine plantations.\n\nAs indicated by their name, the Rapa fruit dove primarily feeds on fleshy fruit from the various trees on the island, as well as nectar from some flowers. There are many productive native berry trees on Rapa Iti to sustain the dove. While the strawberry guava is an invasive species and a cause for habitat decline, it is possible that it is also a source of food for the dove. They eat while perched in the tree and pick or reach for the fruit. Since they are heavier than some other fruit doves, the Rapa fruit dove does not move out to the end of the branches, and instead must perform many contortions to reach the fruit.\n\nThe Rapa fruit dove's decreasing population size is caused by habitat loss. It lives in the forests of Rapa Iti, but very little of the island's original native forests remain. The destruction of the habitat was caused by logging, fires, and an increased need for grazing land for cattle and goats. The quality of the remaining habitat has diminished since the introduction of the invasive strawberry guava from South America. When left unchecked, the strawberry guava can grow uncontrollably in dense thickets and wreak havoc on ecosystems, choking out native species that the fruit dove relies on. Other invasive species, like feral cats, predate on the fruit doves and have been a factor in their decline.\n\nHistorically, the Rapa fruit dove was hunted for food by the indigenous Polynesians. But an improvement in the standard of living on the island had ceased the hunting of the doves. Currently, they are not used for human benefit.\n\nWhile there are no plans for conservation efforts to directly increase the population of the Rapa fruit dove, the necessity of habitat conservation and restoration has recently become recognized on the island. In 2017, a project began with the goal of restoring the forests, controlling the growth of the strawberry guava, and controlling the populations of grazing animals.\n\nAdditional conservation efforts are needed to protect the Rapa fruit dove and the rest of the biodiversity on Rapa Iti. Ecological impacts due to humans are the main cause of declines and extinctions of birds in the Polynesian islands, especially Rapa Iti. More land needs to be effectively protected and managed to decrease grazing pressures and exclude fires from upland areas. There also needs to be increased control of invasive species populations. To directly increase the population of the fruit dove, an introduction to another island to establish a second population is recommended after the introduced mammals are eradicated from the islands. There is also the option of establishing a captive population of fruit doves as a precaution. Education and awareness are needed for the local community to gain their support for creating protected land areas.\n\nFurther research into the actual impacts of the threats to the Rapa fruit dove is needed. It is unknown how feral cats are affecting the population of the fruit dove, and if its predation is a serious problem for their survival. It is also unclear how the Rapa fruit dove uses the strawberry guava, if at all. Additional research into these factors can give a better understanding of the population trends of the fruit dove and help guide conservation practices on the island.", 'score': 886.8393}, {'id': 'Pica_hudsonia', 'name': ['Pica hudsonia'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia), also known as the American magpie, is a bird in the corvid family found in the western half of North America. It is black and white, with the wings and tail showing black areas and iridescent hints of blue and blue-green. It was once thought to be a subspecies of Pica pica, which was known as the black-billed magpie at the time, but was placed into its own species in 2000 based on genetic studies. Currently, Pica pica is the scientific name of the Eurasian magpie.\n\nThis species prefers generally open habitats with clumps of trees, but can also commonly be found in farmlands and suburban areas. Historically associated with bison herds, it now lands on the backs of cattle to glean ticks and insects from them. Black-billed magpies commonly follow large predators, such as wolves, to scavenge from their kills. The species also walks or hops on the ground, where it obtains food items such as beetles, grasshoppers, worms, and small rodents.\n\nThe black-billed magpie builds domed nests which are made up of twigs and are located near the top of trees, usually housing six to seven eggs. Incubation, by the female only, starts when the clutch is complete, and lasts 16–21 days. The nestling period is three to four weeks. Black-billed magpies in the wild have a lifespan of six to seven years.\n\nBlack-billed magpies have a long history with humans, being featured in stories told by Indigenous tribes of the Great Plains. Where persecuted it becomes very wary, but otherwise it is fairly tolerant of human presence. Due to their perceived negative impact on cattle and game birds, black-billed magpies were hunted as a pest during the 1900s, and their population suffered as a result. Today, they are considered a species of least concern by the IUCN, and they are commonly seen throughout their range.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'The black-billed magpie was originally described in 1823 as Corvus Hudsonius by  Joseph Sabine. In previous encounters with the species prior to its description, it was presumed to be of the same species as the magpies from Europe, which at the time where also known as black-billed magpies. Based on the black-billed magpie\'s smaller size and longer tail and wing length, it was classified as the subspecies P. pica hudsonia. The generic name Pica is the Latin word for magpie, and the specific name hudsonia is in honour of the English explorer Henry Hudson.\n\nThe word "magpie" comes from a combination of "Mag", which was a nickname for Margaret, and "pie", which was the Middle English word for the Eurasian magpie. The name Margaret was associated with chattiness in the early 15th century, and was applied to the magpie because its vocalizations were thought to sound like a person chattering.\n\nThe black-billed magpie was widely considered conspecific with the Eurasian magpie until mtDNA studies showed a relatively high divergence between the two species. The species consisting of the black-billed and Eurasian magpies was called the black-billed magpie in English, and its scientific name was Pica pica. It was also shown that the black-billed magpie was more closely related to California\'s yellow-billed magpie (Pica nuttalli). Black-billed magpies are also shown to have different social behaviours and vocalizations from the Eurasian magpie, further indicating separate species. In 2000, the American Ornithologists\' Union recognized the black-billed magpie as a separate species, Pica hudsonia.\n\nFossil evidence suggests that the ancestral North American magpie arrived in its current range around the mid-Pliocene, approximately 3–4 mya, having crossed the Bering land bridge. From there, the Eurasian and North American populations began to differentiate. The yellow-billed magpie lineage likely split off soon after due to the Sierra Nevada uplift and the beginning of an ice age. A comparatively low genetic difference, however, suggests that some gene flow between the black-billed and yellow-billed magpies still occurred during interglacial periods until the Pleistocene.\n\nThe black-billed magpie is an unmistakable bird within its range. It is a medium-sized bird that measures 45–60 centimeters (18–24\xa0in) from tip to tail. It is largely black, with white scapulars, belly, and primaries, and the wings and tail are an iridescent blue-green. The tail is made up of long, layered feathers, the middle pair of which extend further than the rest. The beak is uniformly black, oblong, and weakly curved toward the tip. Adults also have black irises.\n\nUnlike other members of the Corvidae family, the black-billed magpie is dimorphic in size and weight, though there can be overlap between the sexes. Males are, on average, six to nine percent larger and sixteen to twenty-four percent heavier than females, at 167–216 grams (5.9–7.6\xa0oz), an individual wing chord of 205–219 millimeters (8.1–8.6\xa0in), and tail lengths of 230–320 millimeters (9.1–12.6\xa0in). Females weigh between 141–179 grams (5.0–6.3\xa0oz), have individual wing chords of 175–210 millimeters (6.9–8.3\xa0in), and tail lengths of 232–300 millimeters (9.1–11.8\xa0in).\n\nJuveniles have less iridescence on their wings and tail, buffier scapulars and belly, and they lack the distinctive long tail feathers. Their rectrices are typically rounder and narrower, and have more black on their wing-tips compared to mature adults. They also have pink mouth-linings and grey irises. All juvenile features will typically be gone by the first year\'s moult.\n\nThe black-billed magpie can be distinguished from the similar yellow-billed magpie by its longer tail and by the colour of the beak. Eurasian magpies are visually very similar to black-billed magpies; however, Eurasian magpies are slightly larger and have shorter tails and wings. They can also be distinguished based on their different vocalizations, as well as by their non-overlapping ranges.\n\nThe vocalizations of the black-billed magpie consist of a number of calls variously described as tweets, coos, purrs, shrills and squawks, but the most common is an alarm call, called a chatter, that is described as a ka-ka-ka-ka, sometimes preceded with a skah-skah. This call is very different from that of the Eurasian magpie and is similar to that of the yellow-billed magpie. At least one black-billed magpie, living with humans, has learned to imitate human speech.\n\nBlack-billed magpies are generally non-migratory, however some winter movement does occur. While the exact reason for these movements is unknown, it is thought to be a result of postbreeding dispersal and a subsequent return to their nesting sites. This species ranges from coastal southern Alaska, southwest Yukon Territory, central British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba in the north, through the Rocky Mountains down south to all the Rocky Mountain states including New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and some bordering states as well. The range can extend as far east as northern Minnesota and Iowa, with casual records in northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan, but is thought to be limited further east and south by high temperature and humidity. The species is absent in California west of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges, where it is replaced by the yellow-billed magpie.\n\nDuring the breeding season the preferred habitat is riparian areas with thickets. The predilection for open habitats with clumps of trees means that the species lives in meadows and suburbs. Outside the breeding season, magpies can be found in their breeding habitat but also near feedlots, grain elevators, landfills, and around barns and houses.\n\nAdult black-billed magpie typically form pairs which last year-round and often for life, in which case the remaining magpie may find another mate. "Divorces" are possible; one South Dakota study found low rates of divorce (8%) but one study in Alberta found that pairs had a 63% divorce rate over a 7-year period.\n\nBlack-billed magpies nest individually, and often situate their nests near the top of trees. Only the nest tree and its immediate surroundings are defended, and so it is possible for nests to be somewhat clumped in a location. When this happens (usually in areas with a limited number of trees or with abundant food resources), a diffuse colony is formed. In this, the black-billed magpie is intermediate between the Eurasian magpie, whose nests are much more spread out because a large territory is defended around each nest, and the yellow-billed magpie, which is always loosely colonial.\n\nNests are loose but large accumulations of branches, twigs, grass, rootlets, mud, fur, and other materials. Branches and twigs constitute the base and framework, while mud is used as anchor and in the nest cup. The cup is lined with materials found nearby, often grass, rootlets, and other soft material. A hood or dome is present on almost all nests, and if formed of twigs and branches that are loosely assembled. The nest will usually have a single side entrance. Nests are built by both sexes over 40–50 days, starting in February (though later in northern parts of the range). Nests have been shown to be quite durable, and occasionally old nests are repaired and reused across multiple breeding seasons.\n\nIf regularly disturbed, black-billed magpie pairs will aggressively defend their nest. If the disturbances continue, they will eventually either move the eggs or abandon the clutch altogether. Biologists who have climbed nest trees to measure magpie eggs have reported that the parents recognized them personally on subsequent days and started to mob them, overlooking other people in the vicinity.\n\nBlack-billed magpies generally start breeding in late March, with the breeding season ending in early July. While they typically only nest once per year, a second nesting may take place if the initial nesting fails early. The average clutch size is six or seven eggs, however females may lay up to thirteen eggs. The eggs are greenish grey, marked with browns, and 33\xa0mm (1.3\xa0in) long. Incubation lasts 16–21 days and is done only by the female. Hatching is often asynchronous, and hatched young are altricial, brooded by the female but fed by both sexes. Juveniles are able to fly 3–4 weeks after hatching, and will feed with adults for about two months before leaving to join other juvenile magpies. Fledging success (usually 3–4 young per nest) is lower than the typical clutch size; this is not an unusual state of affairs in species with asynchronous hatching, as some nestlings often die of starvation. Black-billed magpies reach sexual maturity at one or two years of age. The lifespan of the species in the wild is about four to six years.\n\nThe black-billed magpie is an opportunistic omnivore, eating whatever is readily available, including carrion, insects, seeds, berries, and nuts. When living near humans, they will also eat garbage and food from pets or livestock that are fed outside. They have been known to hunt rodents, reptiles, amphibians, small birds, and have also been seen eating eggs of other birds. Black-billed magpies primarily feed on animal matter during the summer, and in the winter switch to more vegetation. Chicks are fed animal matter almost exclusively. Magpies typically forage on the ground, scratching with their feet or beaks to turn over ground litter. They often follow large predators, such as wolves, to scavenge or steal from their kills. They sometimes land on large mammals, such as moose, cattle, or deer, to pick at the ticks that often plague these animals.\n\nBlack-billed magpies are also known to make food caches in the ground, in scatter-hoarding fashion. To make a cache, the bird pushes or hammers its bill into the ground (or snow), forming a small hole into which it deposits the food items it was holding in a small pouch under its tongue. It may, however, then move the food to another location, particularly if other magpies in the vicinity are watching. Cache robbing is fairly common, so a magpie often makes several false caches before a real one. The final cache is covered with grass, leaves, or twigs. After this, the bird cocks its head and stares at the cache, possibly to commit the site to memory. Such hoards are short-term; the food is usually recovered within several days, or the bird never returns. The bird relocates its caches by sight and also by smell; during cache robbing, smell is probably the primary cue.\n\nBlack-billed magpies often form loose flocks outside of the breeding season. Dominance hierarchies typically develop within such flocks, more linearly among males than among females. Dominants can steal food from subordinates. Aggressive interactions also occur at point sources of food. Surprisingly, young males appear dominant over adult males, though this may simply reflect the adults\' lack of motivation to engage in fights as they can more easily find food. Fights are rare and involve jumps and kicks. Dominance is more generally established through displays, such as stretching the body laterally with the bill raised and the nictitating membrane of the eye flashing (only on the side of the opponent).\n\nMagpies often gather excitedly in trees near the body of a dead magpie, calling loudly, a poorly-understood behaviour called a funeral.\n\nMagpies tend to roost communally in winter. Every evening they fly, often in groups and sometimes over long distances, to reach safe roosting sites such as dense trees or shrubs that impede predator movement, or, at higher latitudes, dense conifers that afford good wind protection. In Canada, they arrive at the roosting site earlier in the evening and leave later in the morning on colder days. At the roosting site, they tend to occupy trees singly; they do not huddle. They sleep with the bill tucked under the scapular (shoulder) and back feathers, adopting this position sooner on colder nights. During the night, they may also regurgitate in the form of pellets the undigested parts of what they ate during the day. Such pellets can be found on the ground and then used to determine at least part of the birds\' diet.\n\nLevel flight appears slow and labored. As measured in wind tunnels, minimum and maximum sustained flight speeds are 14.5 and 50\xa0km/h (9 and 31\xa0mph), respectively. Flight is commonly interrupted by nonflapping phases. Descents from heights consist of repeated J-shaped swoops with the wings nearly closed.\n\nBlack-billed magpies feature in stories told by various Indigenous tribes from the Great Plains. One story, sometimes known as "The Great Race", features a magpie working with humans in a race against the bison to determine who would be hunter and who would be prey. The race was narrowly won by the magpie, who had clung to the back of the bison until near the end, making humans the hunters and bison the hunted.\n\nWhen Lewis and Clark first encountered black-billed magpies in 1804 in South Dakota, they reported the birds as being very bold, entering tents and taking food from the hand. Magpies formerly followed American bison herds, from which they would glean ticks and other insects, as well as the Indigenous tribes that hunted the bison so they could scavenge carcasses. When the bison herds were devastated in the 1870s, magpies switched to cattle, and by the 1960s, they had also moved into the emerging towns and cities of the West. Today, black-billed magpies remain relatively tame in areas where they are not hunted. However, they become very wary in areas where they are often shot at or disturbed. Black-billed magpies were thought to be harmful to the population of game birds (due to them sometimes stealing bird eggs) and domestic stock (pecking at sores on cattle), and were systematically trapped or shot during the first half of the 20th century. Bounties of one cent per egg or two cents per head were offered in many states. In 1933, bounty hunters in the Okanogan valley in Washington shot 1,033 magpies. Magpies also died as a result of eating poison set out for predators.\n\nBlack-billed magpies are considered a pest by some because of their reputation for stealing smaller songbird eggs. Studies have shown, however, that eggs make up only a small proportion of what magpies feed on during the reproductive season, and that other songbird populations do not fare worse in the presence of magpies.\n\nA common misconception about magpies in general is that they like to steal bright or shiny things. This reputation belongs to the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica) rather than the black-billed magpie, and at any rate an experiment conducted at Exeter University has shown that the reputation is undeserved. Eurasian magpies displayed caution around shiny objects rather than being attracted to them.\n\nBecause of its wide range and generally stable population, the black-billed magpie is rated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. As of 2015, the Government of Canada estimates the population to be between 500,000 and 5,000,000 adults.\n\nIn the United States, black-billed magpies are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, but "[a] Federal permit shall not be required to control ... [magpies] when found committing or about to commit depredations upon ornamental or shade trees, agricultural crops, livestock, or wildlife, or when concentrated in such numbers and manner as to constitute a health hazard or other nuisance". State or local regulations may limit or prohibit killing these birds as well.\n\nIn Canada, however, black-billed magpies do not appear on the list of birds protected by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. Provincial laws also apply, but in Alberta, magpies may be hunted and trapped without a license.\n\nA detriment to the overall black-billed magpie population is toxic chemicals, particularly topical pesticides applied on the backs of livestock. Because black-billed magpies sometimes glean ticks off the backs of cattle, this proves a problem. However, in some areas, it has benefited from forest fragmentation and agricultural developments. Like many corvids, it is susceptible to West Nile virus.', 'score': 870.3782}, {'id': 'Pterapogon', 'name': ['Pterapogon'], 'introduction': "\n\nThe Banggai cardinalfish (Pterapogon kauderni) is a small tropical cardinalfish in the family Apogonidae. It is the only member of its genus. This attractive fish is popular in the aquarium trade. It is among the relatively few marine fish to have been bred regularly in captivity, but significant numbers are still captured in the wild and it is now an endangered species. The detrimental impact of humans on its environment and certain fatal diseases threaten this species' numbers significantly. Iridovirus diseases are known to be significant reason for fish mortality.", 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "This species is restricted to the Banggai Islands of Indonesia. This species has an extremely limited geographic range (5,500\xa0km2) and small total population size (estimated at 2.4\xa0million). The Banggai cardinalfish is composed of isolated populations concentrated around the shallows of 17 large and 10 small islands within the Banggai Archipelago. A small population also occurs off Central Sulawesi, within Luwuk harbor. One additional population has become established in the Lembeh Strait (North Sulawesi), 400\xa0km north of the natural area of the species distribution, following introduction by aquarium fish traders in 2000. Small populations seen (May 2014) in Secret Bay, north west Bali (Banggai cardinal fish, Secret Bay, Bali)\n\nThis species grows up to 8\xa0centimetres (3\xa0in) total length. It is easily differentiated from all other cardinalfishes by its tasseled first dorsal fin, elongated anal and second dorsal fin rays, deeply forked caudal fin, and color pattern consisting of three black bars across the head and body and prominent black anterior edges on the anal and second dorsal fin. The male can be differentiated from the female by a conspicuous, enlarged oral cavity, which is apparent only when they are brooding.\n\nThe Banggai cardinalfish is the only member of its family that is diurnal. It is a demersal tropical marine fish that forms stable groups of about 9 individuals in shallow water, being most common at 1.5 to 2.5 m in depth. It inhabits a variety of shallow habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and open areas of sand and rubble. It is most common in calm habitats on the protected side of larger islands.\n\nIt is often found associated with the seagrass Enhalus acoroides and the long spined sea urchin Diadema setosum. It occurs among various living benthic substrates such as sea urchins, sea anemones, and branching corals; young fish are most commonly associated with sea anemones, while juveniles and adults occur most frequently among long-spined sea urchins and branching corals, as well as sea stars, hydrozoans, and mangrove prop roots. Individuals of 2 to 60 hover above the urchins, with the younger ones about 2 to 3 centimeters SL staying closest to them. The fish retreat among the spines when threatened. Individual fish exhibit well-defined homing behaviour and return to the original location of their group when disturbed. The Banggai cardinalfish often coexists with various anemonefish and anemone shrimp when sheltering in anemones and corals; when found among sea urchin spines, it associates with several other genera of cardinalfish. Following removal of the fish by aquarium collectors, the abundance of associated invertebrates has been shown to decline.\n\nBanggai cardinalfish live in shallow lagoons in groups that include up to 500 individuals. They are often found near sea urchins, where the fish hide when threatened. They are capable of hiding among the spines of sea urchins without being stung. In addition to sea urchins, other living benthic substrates such as soft corals, anemones, hydrozoans, and mangrove roots also serve as microhabitats around which the cardinalfish group. These groups of fish are rather sedentary, and movements between groups are observed to be very limited, especially because they feed on plankton that pass through water currents. Such limited dispersal of Banggai cardinalfish prevents them from spreading over large geographic ranges, thus serving as a major risk of extinction along with heavy exploitation by aquarium fish collectors, as well as low fecundity.\n\nThis fish is an opportunistic feeder. Its diet includes planktonic, demersal, and benthic organisms. Copepods constitute the bulk of its diet. It serves as an important food source for several species of lionfish (Pterois spp.), the honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra), the crocodilefish (Cymbacephalus beauforti), the snowflake moray (Echidna nebulosa), the estuarine stonefish (Synanceia horrida), and the yellow-lipped sea krait (Laticauda colubrina).\n\nThe Banggai cardinalfish is a paternal mouthbrooder. The female plays an active role in courtship and pair formation, which occurs a few hours to a few days before spawning. Mating pairs establish spawning territories several meters away from the main group and vigorously defend them. The eggs are about 2.5\xa0mm in diameter. The young remain in the male's mouth cavity for an undetermined period after hatching. Unlike many other species of marine fish, the Banggai cardinalfish lacks a planktonic stage in its life history. The species has a short lifespan, reaching around 4 years in optimal conditions in captivity, and perhaps 1 to 2 years in the wild.\n\nBanggai cardinalfish are sexually monomorphic. The pairs form up to 2 weeks prior to spawning. The female courts the male from pair formation until spawning. The female's size determines the fecundity and egg size, but the male's size determines the reproductive output, or the number of the eggs that the pair produces. Therefore, pairing tends to occur among individuals of similar sizes, so the male is able to care for all the eggs that the female produces.\n\nIn Banggai cardinalfish, courtship behavior is usually initiated by the female. Upon choosing a mate, the female isolates her potential mate from other individuals in the colony by creating a spherical spawning site that is about 50–60\xa0cm in diameter. The general movement that the female exhibits is called‘side by side trembling' which is when the female approaches the male from behind with a vigorous trembling motion while the male stays motionless. Then she places herself alongside him and tilts her body thirty degrees outward from its vertical plane, when the male and female's caudal and anal fins come into contact. The female repeats this movement until the male responds with sporadic 'mouth opening,’ a sign of receptiveness. Such courtship behavior may last from several hours to 2–33 days. When an intruder interrupts a female's courtship behavior, the female would rapidly and aggressively chase the intruder away if the intruder is of the same sex. However, when the secondary male, or the intruder male approaches, he, instead of the female, exhibits trembling behavior, and also helps to defend the female and primary male's isolated territory. If the primary male does not respond to female's trembling, the female leaves periodically to visit the secondary male and displays trembling behavior which often results in mating.\n\nAlthough the females initiate courtship, female and male cardinalfish are mutually selective. Females have been observed courting larger males more intensively. Even when they are already in the process of courting one male, they often moved on to an intruder male if it is larger than the original. Females have also been observed producing larger eggs for larger, hence more 'attractive,’ males. Females are also able to increase egg size even after the onset of egg maturation if they encounter a new, larger male to brood its eggs.\nMale Banggai cardinalfish also exhibit preference by size, as larger females tend to lay larger eggs, and egg size positively affects traits such as offspring size, survival, growth, time until maturation, and swimming performance. However, it also takes into account information conveyed by females' courting movement. The 'side by side trembling' described in the previous section can be subcategorized into two different movements: 'rush' and 'twitch'. 'Rush' refers to the first part of the movement when the females approaches the male, folding her pelvic, dorsal, and anal fins together and quickly swimming past the male for a distance of 10–40\xa0cm. Then she performs the 'twitch' by twitching or trembling her body close to the male. The intensity of the 'rush' behavior is important for the male in predicting the female's potential reproductive effort, as the intensity of the behavior correlates positively with clutch weight. However, the number of twitches performed per day strongly associates with how close to spawning the female is. By forming a pair with a female with more mature eggs, or closer to spawning, a male can increase his reproductive rate. Furthermore, he can match his readiness to spawn to females' by observing her 'twitch' behavior.\n\nWhen the male accepts female courting, the female expels eggs from her urogenital papilla. Female Banggai cardinalfish produce a relatively small clutch, consisting of no more than 90 eggs that are 2–3\xa0mm in diameter. Once about three-fourths of the egg mass protrudes from the female, the male takes the eggs from her. This process is immediate, taking no more than 2 seconds. Eggs may be lost in the process if the male drops them, as they are usually immediately consumed by other fish in the area. Males also have the ability to detect dead eggs and expel them from their mouths. The male broods the eggs in his mouth up to 30 days, during which he does not feed. After spawning, the female stays with the brooding male for at least a few days. Females aggressively defend their territory by immediately chasing any intruders that approach the brooding males. They also exhibit a relaxed form of 'side-by-side trembling', and confine the males to a small space.\n\nJuvenile Banggai cardinalfish do not go through any pelagic larval phase. Instead, they experience a high growth rate. Although the free embryos maintain their size difference after hatching, they increase several times in weightwhile being brooded inside their father's mouth. Therefore, at release, juveniles are many times heavier than they were at hatching. Juveniles settle directly within the parents' habitat upon release from their father's mouth. They form a tight school around different structures such as sea urchins, corals, and anemones, and swim around together while the father does not exhibit much caring behavior.\n\nThe Banggai cardinalfish is a popular aquarium fish among fishkeepers.\n\nThe fish is collected by local fishers and sold into the aquarium trade. This species first appeared in the international trade around 1995 or 1996. By 2001, 600,000 to 700,000 fish were exported annually. Trade estimates for 2001 through 2004 are 700,000 to 900,000 fish per year with collection occurring throughout the archipelago. Surveys identified significant (>90%) declines in two populations that were fished from 2001 to 2004, including the extinction of a population off of Limbo Island.\n\nThis fish has been successfully bred in captivity. Captive breeding presents an alternative to wild-caught fish. Initially, the relatively high cost–benefit ratio of its production combined with the large number of less expensive wild-harvested fish prevented expansion of aquaculture efforts. In recent years, prices for captive bred or aquacultured specimens have plummeted as large numbers have entered the market. As of early 2018 aquacultured individuals are regularly available for as little as $14 U.S. per fish, and aquacultured specimens make up the vast majority of the market. In addition, a newly emerging threat in the form of a viral disease has been documented in wild-harvested individuals maintained in captivity.\n\nCollection for the aquarium trade has threatened this species with extinction. This increases the demand for captive-bred specimens. It is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN based on its small range, the fragmentation of its distribution, and its continuing decline due to exploitation for the international aquarium trade. In 2007, the species was proposed to be listed for protection under CITES Appendix II, which could limit export of wild-caught individuals, but Indonesia would not support this, and the proposal was withdrawn.", 'score': 869.1352}, {'id': 'Spizella_atrogularis', 'name': ['Spizella atrogularis'], 'introduction': '\n\n\n\nSpinites atrogularis Cabanis, 1851\nStruthus atrimentalis Couch, 1854\nSpizella evura Coues, 1866\nSpizella atrigularis Salvin & Godman, 1886\n\nThe black-chinned sparrow (Spizella atrogularis) is a small bird in the genus Spizella, in the New World sparrow family Passerellidae. It is found in the southwestern United States and throughout much of Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; most populations in the US migrate south after breeding while those in Mexico are resident. It is a slim, long-tailed bird, primarily gray with a reddish-brown back streaked with black, brown wings and tail, a pink beak, and brownish legs and feet. In the breeding season, the male shows black on his throat, chin, and the front of his face. Females, youngsters and nonbreeding males show little or no black in these areas. An unobtrusive bird, it spends much of its time foraging slowly along the ground, either alone or in small groups, sometimes mixing with other Spizella species. It is an omnivore, feeding primarily on seeds during the winter and insects during the summer. It builds a cup-shaped nest of grasses, rootlets, or plant fibers, into which the female lays 2–5 pale blue eggs. The female does most or all of the egg incubation, but both parents feed the hatched nestlings.\n\nThe species was first described by Jean Louis Cabanis in 1851. Four subspecies have been identified: one breeds only in the US, one only in Mexico, and the other two breed in both countries. Most northern populations move south—primarily into Mexico—for the winter. Because of its apparently large population size and very large range, it is considered to be a species of least concern. However, increasing global temperatures could have a significantly negative impact on its numbers.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'German ornithologist Jean Louis Cabanis first described the black-chinned sparrow in 1851, using a specimen which is thought to have been collected near Mexico City. He called it Spinites atrogularis. Within the decade, most authorities had moved it to the genus Spizella, where it has remained since. It is one of six small New World sparrows in the genus, and is known  to have hybridized with Brewer\'s sparrow, a congener. Mitochondrial DNA studies have shown that the field sparrow is its closest relative.  There are four recognized subspecies:\n\nThe genus name Spizella is a diminutive of the Ancient Greek word spiza, meaning "finch". The species name atrogularis is a combination of the Latin ater, meaning "black" and gularis, meaning "-throated" (from gula, meaning "throat"). The common name "sparrow" is an English word which was in use prior to the 12th century. Though originally used for the house sparrow, a common European species, its usage expanded to the unrelated New World sparrows because of their similar appearance.\n\nThe black-chinned sparrow is a small passerine, measuring 5\xa0to 5+3⁄4\xa0in. (13–15\xa0cm) in length, with a wingspan of roughly 7+3⁄4\xa0in. (19–20\xa0cm). It weighs 0.3–0.5\xa0oz (9.0–14.8\xa0g), with a median weight of 0.4\xa0oz (11.3\xa0g). Overall, it is a slender, round-headed bird, with a high crown and a long, notched tail, which is proportionately longer than that of other Spizella sparrows. The sexes are similar, though the male averages slightly larger. The adult\'s head and body are gray, and its back is reddish-brown with black streaks. It has a "poorly defined" whitish belly, and its rump and uppertail coverts are an unstreaked gray. The feathers in its wings and tail are dark brown with paler edges (white in the tail). In alternate plumage (during the breeding season), the male has extensive black on its chin, throat and the front of its face. It loses most or all of this black during the nonbreeding season; the oldest males may retain some black flecking. The female has little or no black on her face, chin, or throat at any point during the year. In basic plumage, males and females can be difficult to tell apart. The juvenile resembles a nonbreeding adult, but shows indistinct streaking on its underparts, and two faint wingbars. The head and underparts have a brownish wash, and its outer scapulars are tawny-colored. The legs and feet are dark brown or dusky, and the bill is small, stout, and pink. Recent fledglings may have darker bills, as well as notably short tails, yellow gapes, and paler gray heads.\n\n\n\nIts call is a high, soft tsip or stip. In flight it gives a soft ssip, a call said to resemble that of the chipping sparrow. The song is a series of clear, high-pitched whistles that accelerate into a rapid trill, which typically rises in pitch. Though similar to the song of the field sparrow, it is higher-pitched and more "mechanical". The accelerating trill is said to sound like a dropped ping pong ball.\n\nThe combination of gray head and body is unique among New World sparrows. Though similar in plumage to the dark-eyed junco, the black-chinned sparrow is slimmer, and has a streaked back, brown edges to its wing feathers, and no white in its tail.\n\nThe black-chinned sparrow breeds in the southwestern United States and throughout much of Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. It is regularly found from northern California east to western Texas, and as far north as southern Nevada and Utah, and has occurred as a vagrant or occasional breeder in Oregon and Colorado. A species of arid and semi-arid places, it lives in chaparral, sagebrush, pine-juniper woodlands, and other brushy shrubland. Much of its habitat is in remote, rugged, and rocky areas. It is significantly less common in edge habitat, and rare near the coast. It is found at elevations ranging from near sea level to 2,400\xa0m (8,000\xa0ft) in the United States, and from 300 to 2,500\xa0m (980 to 8,200\xa0ft) in Mexico. Some birds in Utah may move into desert ecotones as part of a post-breeding dispersal and some northern populations move into Chihuahuan Desert scrub during the winter. Most northern populations move south – primarily into Mexico – during the winter; some move to lower elevations as well. During migration, it is sometimes recorded in montane oak forest, but not in mixed pine-oak forest.\n\nAlthough the black-chinned sparrow appears to be relatively common where it occurs, it is an inconspicuous species that can be easy to overlook. In Mexico, it is generally found singly or in pairs, and only rarely in small groups. In the United States, it is sometimes found in small, loose groups, occasionally mingling with Brewer\'s or chipping sparrows. It flies close to the ground, with an undulating flight style. Though the species often remains in deep cover, breeding males defy that more typical behavior and pick conspicuous, exposed perches from which to sing.\n\nThe black-chinned sparrow forages on or near the ground, spending considerable time working in the same area. Though its diet is not well-known, it appears to feed primarily on seeds as a ground-gleaning granivore in the winter, and on insects as a ground-foraging omnivore in the summer. It occasionally captures insects in flight, and may feed on seeds while perched in a bush. It appears to obtain all of the moisture it needs from its food during the summer, but in the winter may travel a considerable distance to reach a water source.\n\nMuch of the breeding ecology of the black-chinned sparrow is poorly known. It breeds primarily from late April into June, though active nests have been found as late as the middle of July. Males sing from open perches within their territory, which may encompass as much as 2 hectares (4.9 acres). Neighboring males often counter-sing, alternately responding to their singing rivals. They also aggressively chase each other. The nest is a shallow, open cup built of plant material, including grasses, weed stems, rootlets, or yucca fibers. This is lined with fibers or fine grasses, and occasionally with hair or feathers. It is located within 4\xa0ft (1.2\xa0m) of the ground, typically at mid-level in a dense shrub. The female does the bulk of the nest building, though the male may help. The nest is occasionally parasitized by cowbirds.\n\nThe female lays 2–5\xa0very pale blue or bluish-green eggs. These are typically unmarked, though occasionally speckled with brown spots. Incubation takes roughly 13\xa0days, and is done primarily (or possibly completely) by the female. The young are altricial – featherless with eyes closed upon hatching. Both parents provide food for the nestlings and remove fecal sacs for the 11–13 days it takes for the young to fledge. Adults continue to feed the fledglings for several weeks after they leave the nest. Most pairs raise a single brood per year, though there are records of a few pairs attempting multiple broods in southern California. Pairs stay together only for the length of breeding season. Nests suffer a high rate of failure; in one study in southern California, fewer than 30 percent of nesting attempts were successful. Most eggs and young are lost to predators. Garter snakes are known nest predators. Other suspected nest predators include western scrub jays, snakes, lizards, rodents, and ants.\n\nThe black-chinned sparrow is one of the species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Its overall population has not been quantified, but its numbers are known to be decreasing. Estimates of its global population range from 450,000 to 1,100,000. The North American Breeding Bird Survey shows that the black-chinned sparrow\'s numbers declined at an average rate of 5.1 percent annually between 1966 and 2003, while Partners in Flight reports that the sparrow\'s numbers dropped 62 percent between 1970 and 2014. However, it is known to be poorly sampled by breeding bird surveys in several states, including New Mexico and Texas. It is considered to be a "Bird of Conservation Concern" by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. On the other hand, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers it to be a species of least concern, due to its substantial population and very large range.\n\nThe black-chinned sparrow is known to carry several blood parasites, including members of the genera Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma. Specimens carrying West Nile virus have been found dead. Due to its avoidance of edge habitat, the black-chinned sparrow is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Because of that vulnerability, it may be a useful species for indicating environmental changes. It may also be adversely affected by climate change; between 2000 and 2020, its breeding range shifted perceptibly northwards. The National Audubon Society predicts that by 2080, none of its current breeding range will still be in use. Its winter range is predicted to be more stable, with some 65 percent of the current area still in use by 2080, and the total area of wintering range in the United States potentially increasing.', 'score': 864.2841}, {'id': 'Hydrocharis_morsus-ranae', 'name': ['Hydrocharis morsus-ranae'], 'introduction': '\n\nHydrocharis morsus-ranae L. is a species of the genus Hydrocharis known by the common name European frog-bit. It is a free-floating flowering plant that bears small white flowers. "Morsus-ranae" means "frog bite" in Latin, and it is part of this species\' scientific name because frogs might seen as biting on the leaves. European frog-bit is often mistaken for an American frog-bit (Limnobium spongia) due to their similar looks and floating freely. It usually displays invasive behavior in Canada and North America, having a major impact on native ecosystems. However, European frog-bit is efficient in accumulating high concentrations of heavy metals and chemicals, removing waste from water.', 'sections': "Hydrocharis morsus-ranae is a perennial plant with a stoloniferous growth, reaching a diameter of 0.1 to 1.5 meters. It forms individual rosettes ranging from 1 to 30cm. While mainly having separate male and female plants, it sometimes shows both sexes on different shoots within a group of plants (genet) rather than within the same rosette. The plant has unbranched white roots that extend up to 50cm and have numerous extended root hairs. The circular floating leaves display visible aerenchyma on the undersurface. The slender petioles, 6–14cm, have two free lateral stipules at the base.\n\nThe flowers of Hydrocharis morsus-ranae have unique features. They are either male or female, and both types are symmetrical and attract insects for pollination. The male flowers are grouped in a certain way, with 2-5 buds covered by two protective leaves. These leaves support the first two blooming flowers. In contrast, female flowers always grow alone and are surrounded by a single tubular structure. Both male and female flowers have three greenish-red sepals and white petals. Importantly, all other reproductive parts in these flowers are bright yellow.\n\nHydrocharis morsus-ranae is native to Europe and Asia and found in slow-flowing rivers, stagnant waters, aquatic ditches, and oxbow lakes. It was initially introduced to Canada and North America in 1932 and has become invasive in eastern Canada and some northern states of the United States. European frog-bit is considered a pest in these regions as it colonizes waterways and forms dense masses of vegetation on the surface, threatening native biodiversity. Thus, it is prohibited to trade or transport this plant in states such as Washington and Minnesota.\n\nHydrocharis morsus-ranae tends to accumulate more metals in its organ when it grows near factories compared to farms or recreational areas. The plant naturally has high amounts of certain metals like potassium, cobalt, iron, and nitrogen, regardless of where it grows. The researchers discovered that the plant is good at absorbing and storing specific metals, making it a potential candidate for cleaning up water pollution. However, more research is needed to find the best conditions for its growth and make sure too many metals won't harm the plant.", 'kingdom': 'Plantae', 'score': 863.2613}, {'id': 'Aestuariicella', 'name': ['Aestuariicella'], 'introduction': '\n\nA. hydrocarbonica\n\nAestuariicella is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative, and strictly aerobic genus of bacteria from the order Alteromonadales with one known species (Aestuariicella hydrocarbonica).

Due to the recent nature of its discovery, its taxonomic classification has not yet been accepted.  Future research into its evolutionary history and genome may change the naming of this organism.\n\nWhile rare in seawater, A. hydrocarbonica has shown a strong association with plastic debris of various polymer types. It is commonly found along with other  gammaproteobacteria capable of degrading hydrocarbons and other high-molecular-mass polymers.  Bio-degradation tests have shown that it is capable of breaking down a variety of hydrocarbon polymers. However, it does not degrade the plant polymers casein and starch . These organisms are tetracycline sensitive, but are vulnerable to all other common antibiotics.\n\nThe distribution of A. hydrocarbonica is not yet described, but studies have found its presence in samples from South Korea  and the Mediterranean Sea. This suggests that it may have a broad geographic distribution or be associated with area with high human impact.', 'score': 855.7833}, {'id': 'Acalymma_vittatum', 'name': ['Acalymma vittatum'], 'introduction': "\n\nAcalymma vittatum, the striped cucumber beetle, is a beetle of the family Chrysomelidae and a serious pest of cucurbit crops in both larval and adult stages. The striped cucumber beetle has a distinctive appearance, displaying a yellow-colored elytra with black stripes. It is distributed from eastern North America to the Rocky Mountains and can be found as far south as Mexico and as far North as southern Canada. In western North America, past the Rocky Mountains, the striped cucumber beetle is replaced by Acalymma trivittatum, a duller colored species often with grayish or pale white elytra rather than yellow.\n\nThe striped cucumber beetle is unique in that it is resistant to a chemical, cucurbitacin, that is found in plants and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. In fact, the striped cucumber beetles are drawn towards this chemical; this is an example of coevolution, where one species evolves a phenotype against a defensive phenotype of another. The reason they are called the striped cucumber beetle is because they are found commonly in cucurbit plants, like cucumbers.\n\nMale striped cucumber beetles also release pheromones that cause aggregation of other striped cucumber beetles to the site of feeding. This creates opportunities for the males to mate with females.\n\nDue to the striped cucumber beetle's detrimental effect on cucurbit crops, such as cucumbers and pumpkins, many management methods have been developed to curb striped beetle populations in the early spring to reduce the negative impact on farmers. Some examples include biological control agents and strategies involving bait crops.", 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "Adult striped cucumber beetles have a distinctive yellow-colored elytra with black stripes. In most cases, it consists of three black stripes that span across the length of the elytra. The color of their heads is either black or brown. The color of their prothorax is yellow. Beneath the black-striped elytra is a black abdomen.\n\nAdult striped cucumber beetles can often be confused with western corn rootworm adults. Western corn rootworm adults also have a yellow-colored elytra with three black stripes, a yellow prothorax, and a brown or black head. However, Western corn rootworm adults are longer than striped cucumber beetle adults. Whereas the length of the adult striped cucumber beetle is around 5.25 mm, the length of the western corn rootworm is around 6.3 mm. Furthermore, the black stripes of western corn rootworm adults do not fully span across the entire elytra, but begin to fade off before it reaches the tip. Thus, Adult striped cucumber beetles can be differentiated from western corn rootworms by being, on average, around 1 mm shorter than western corn rootworms and having black stripes that extend all the way to the end of their elytra.\n\nThe striped cucumber beetle pupa is around 10 mm in length. Their abdomen is white. From the center of the abdomen to the end, the width of the pupa becomes more narrow until it forms a rounded tip at the end.\n\nThe striped cucumber beetle is native to many countries of North America. Its distribution stretches from Mexico to southern Canada and is found in large populations in the eastern United States. This species is more limited in the western stretch of North America, including the states and provinces located west of the Rocky Mountains. In this region, the Acalymma trivittatum, or the western striped cucumber beetle, is the dominant species.\n\nWhile feeding on these cucurbits, the adult striped cucumber beetles are drawn toward the cotyledon, which is a portion of an embryo inside the seed of a plant. Although the cotyledons have evolved to hold a chemical called cucurbitacins, a chemical that is found in plants as a design mechanism to repel herbivores, the striped cucumber beetles have evolved to favor the feeding of this chemical. This is an example of coevolution, where an evolution by plants to produce a defense chemical has been favored through striped cucumber beetle evolution. This allows the striped cucumber beetle to feed on cucurbitacin-containing seeds that other herbivores are repelled from.\n\nStriped cucumber beetles also release a pheromone while feeding on cucurbits, which is a type of chemical insects and animals use to communicate with, to inform other striped cucumber beetles of the food source. This draws more striped cucumber beetles to the source, where aggregation can lead to mating.\n\nIn Massachusetts, it was found that the cucumber striped beetle is attracted to several other chemicals emitted by cucurbits, including 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene and indole, though not (E)-cinnamaldehyde. In Illinois, the cucumber striped beetle was found to be attracted to indole and (E)-cinnamaldehyde, but not 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene.\n\nA. vittatum exhibits aggregation behavior during feeding and mating as adult beetles tend to group together on host plants, forming dense populations during the growing season. Aggregation behavior may facilitate mate finding and increase efficiency in locating suitable food sources, contributing to the pest's reproductive success. Furthermore, A. vittatum larvae often feeding in clusters on plant tissues such as leaves and stems. This gregarious feeding behavior may lead to significant damage to host plants, especially in the early stages of crop growth.\n\nDuring the cold winter, adult striped cucumber beetles take shelter under small plants near fields where cucurbit crops, the preferred host plant of striped cucumber beetles, will grow in the spring. When soil temperatures rise above 13oC or 55oF, the adult striped cucumber beetles begin feeding on the leaves and pollen of plants that begin growing earlier than cucurbits. These include aster flowers and willow trees. Once cucurbit plants begin growing, the adults begin moving away from the initial plants to the cucurbits and begin aggregating on the crop. One motive for this behavior is to find a potential mate.\n\nAfter the adult beetles mate, the females will lay their eggs below the soil at the base of cucurbit plants (Eaton 2016). Females lay up to four eggs at one time. The depth at which they will deposit the eggs into the soil is around 5 cm. The distance they deposit the eggs can be up to 15 from the base of the cucurbits (Ellers 2006). Once the larvae develop, they will burrow down to feed on the roots of the cucurbit plant and then move back up to the surface as adults.\n\nAcalymma vittatum faces predation pressure from a variety of natural enemies, including insectivorous birds, predatory insects, and parasitoids which significantly reduced beetle abundance. Additionally, parasitoids play a crucial role in regulating A. vittatum populations. Parasitoid wasps such as Tetrastichus giffardianus have been identified as important natural enemies of A. vittatum larvae, parasitizing and suppressing beetle populations in cucurbit fields.\n\nMale adult cucumber striped beetles that are the first to begin feeding on cucurbits, like a cucumber, release aggregation pheromone that attracts both sexes. However, females are more drawn towards this signal. It was found that in captured cucumber striped beetles that were feeding on crops, males only made up less than a quarter of the total number of trapped cucumber striped beetles. These initial males are known as pioneer males whose secreted pheromone have the ability to start a new colony. Therefore, one criterion for a male to be attractive to females is that he has to be in an area with suitable amounts of food. It was found that females were more drawn to males located on host plants rather than host plants or males alone.\n\nDuring the spring, when adult striped cucumber beetles appear from beneath their overwintering shelter, they start feeding on many types of plants including fruits, foliage, and flowers. Feeding on flowers can cause defoliation and lower the survivability of the flowers. Feeding on fruits can cause damage such as caring. This consequence reduces the amount of fruit farmers can harvest, which can harm farmers and cause problems for the fruit industry. The types of crops adult striped cucumber beetles feed on are many types of cucurbits. These crops are also called the gourd family. They include zucchini, squash, cucumbers, pumpkins, watermelon, butternut squash, and other types of gourds.\n\nStriped cucumber beetles can also cause damage to crops by transmitting the Erwinia tracheiphila bacteria to plants. The bacteria first infects the striped cucumber beetle when they are overwintering beneath foliage that is also infected with Erwinia tracheiphila. In the spring, once Striped cucumber beetles begin feeding, they can pass along this bacteria, which harms the plant by growing in its vascular system and blocking the flow of water and nutrients. Due to the extensive damage that can be caused by a bacterial infection, the damage caused by the transmission of Erwinia tracheiphila by the striped cucumber beetles can be much more severe than the damage caused by direct feeding.\n\nSince striped cucumber beetles are particularly attracted to plant seeds, monitoring of striped cucumber beetles is important when seedlings first begin to emerge in early spring. Previous studies have shown that striped cucumber beetles are most active in feeding during the morning and early evening. Furthermore, newly emerged plants are most vulnerable to damage from striped cucumber beetles.\n\nSince striped cucumber beetle activity is highest early on in the spring season, monitoring and managing the striped cucumber beetle early on is important to reduce the negative impacts of their feeding.\n\nThere are several methods to manage the population of striped cucumber beetles. One method is the use of biological control agents. Previously, arthropods that predate on striped cucumber beetles like spiders, rove beetles, and ground beetles have been used. Other types of predators include vertebrates, such as bats, which have also been used. Additionally flies, such as the Celatoria setosaI have been used to target striped cucumber beetles. These flies are a type of parasites that target striped cucumber beetles. Studies have shown that these parasitoid flies can infect around 43-54% of a striped cucumber beetle population.\n\nFarmers can also implement different strategies to delay or limit the onset of striped cucumber beetle feeding. Due to striped cucumber beetle's attraction towards the chemical cucurbitacin in cucurbit crops, farmers can plant cucurbits that contain lower concentrations of cucurbitacin in areas with high concentrations of striped cucumber beetles. It was found that striped cucumber beetles were less drawn toward crops with lower amounts of cucurbitacin. In addition to selecting crops with low levels of cucurbitacin, farmers can select crops that have resistance against the Erwinia tracheiphila bacteria. One example of such a crop is watermelon while cucumber is highly prone to infection.\n\nFarmers can also plant bait crops with high amounts of cucurbitacin on the perimeter of the field to attract striped cucumber beetles away from their main produce. Striped cucumber beetle-specific insecticides can then be sprayed on the bait crop rather than using a broad-spectrum insecticide on the entire field. This is beneficial because too much usage of broad-spectrum insecticides can cause insects to build resistance easily.\n\nSome research indicates that striped cucumber beetle damage can be reduced by the use of vermicompost fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer. Researchers suggest that the mechanism by which vermicompost reduces beetle damage is due to an increase in phenolic compounds in plants grown with vermicompost.", 'score': 851.3881}, {'id': 'Porolithon', 'name': ['Porolithon'], 'introduction': '\n\nPorolithon is a genus of coralline red algae. although more species have been recently proposed.

These vessels solely communicate with the ring canal and not with the radial canals. Four species belong to the genus Crambionella (Stiasny, 1921): C. annandalei (Rao, 1931), C. helmbiru (Nishikawa, Mulyadi & Ohtsuka, 2014), C. orsini (Vanhöffen, 1888) and C. stuhlmanni (Chun, 1896).

Their capability to cycle nutrients and swiftly store carbon through decomposed blooms underscores their significance as a crucial component of the ocean environment. Jellyfish blooms can have negative impacts as well, particularly those of scyphozoan jellyfish. There is a link to the decline of coastal marine ecosystems, with reports of increased occurrences globally, potentially stemming from overfishing and human activities.

C. stuhlmanni demonstrates broad euryhaline characteristics, as it has been observed across salinity levels spanning from 12 to 65%. Its highest recorded densities are typically linked with the upper ranges of salinity. This suggests its adaptation to the fluctuating conditions present in the St. Lucia system.

C. annandalei inhabits the waters during the summer and the first two months of the pre-monsoon season. During the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, C. annandalei are scarce or completely absent. The reason behind the observable seasonal patterns remains unclear, though it is theorized that they arise from regional and local circulation patterns as well as the inherent life cycle of the species.\n\nC. helmbiru resides in the coastal waters of Java in the Indian Ocean. It is found in bloom during both summer and winter (August–December).\n\nRhizostomeae is widely consumed due to their larger size and sturdier bodies compared to other scyphozoans.

C. annandalei is caught in the largest quantities in the Andhra Pradesh state of India, and is one of the main supporters of the commercial jellyfish industry in the region. In the region, C. annandalei is called 'Munthakaya' (in the language Telugu). In India, the harvesting of edible jellyfish began in 1980, with the primary goal being exportation of the jellyfish. Catching these jellyfish offers small-scale fishermen an additional income, accounting for approximately 20–25% of their annual earnings. Local fisherman catch C. annandalei using gillnets strung at a depth of 50 m or less from the back of boats. C. annadalei is the most harvested of the 3 commercial species of Crambionella.

The vertebral column surrounds and protects the spinal cord, while the cranium protects the brain.\n\nThe vertebrates make up the subphylum Vertebrata with some 65,000 species, by far the largest grouping in the phylum Chordata. The vertebrates include mammals, birds, amphibians, and various classes of fish and reptiles. The fish include the jawless Agnatha, and the jawed Gnathostomata. The jawed fish include both the cartilaginous fish and the bony fish. Bony fish include the lobe-finned fish, which gave rise to the tetrapods, the animals with four limbs. Vertebrates make up less than five percent of all described animal species.\n\nThe first vertebrates appeared in the Cambrian explosion some 518 million years ago. Jawed vertebrates evolved in the Ordovician, followed by bony fishes in the Devonian. The first amphibians appeared on land in the Carboniferous. During the Triassic, mammals and dinosaurs appeared, the latter giving rise to birds in the Jurassic. Extant species are roughly equally divided between fishes of all kinds, and tetrapods. Populations of many species have been in steep decline since 1970 because of  land-use change, overexploitation of natural resources, climate change, pollution and the impact of invasive species.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'Vertebrates belong to the chordates, a phylum characterised by five synapomorphies (unique characteristics), namely a notochord, a hollow nerve cord along the back, an endostyle (often as a thyroid gland), and pharyngeal gills arranged in pairs. Vertebrates share these characteristics with other chordates.\n\nVertebrates are distinguished from all other animals, including other chordates, by multiple synapomorphies, namely the vertebral column; skull of bone or cartilage, large brain divided into 3 or more sections, a muscular heart with multiple chambers; an inner ear with semicircular canals; sense organs including eyes, ears, and nose; and digestive organs including intestine, liver, pancreas, and stomach.\n\nVertebrates (and other chordates) belong to the Bilateria, a group of animals with mirror symmetrical bodies. They move, typically by swimming, using muscles along the back, supported by a strong but flexible skeletal structure, the spine or vertebral column. The name \'vertebrate\' derives from the Latin vertebratus, \'jointed\', from vertebra, \'joint\', in turn from Latin vertere, \'to turn\'.\n\nAs embryos, vertebrates still have a notochord; as adults, all but the jawless fishes have a vertebral column, made of bone or cartilage, instead. Vertebrate embryos have pharyngeal arches; in adult fish, these support the gills, while in adult tetrapods they develop into other structures.\n\nIn the embryo, a layer of cells along the back folds and fuses into a hollow neural tube. This develops into the spinal cord, and at its front end, the brain. The brain receives information about the world through nerves which carry signals from sense organs in the skin and body. Because the ancestors of vertebrates usually moved forwards, the front of the body encountered stimuli before the rest of the body, favouring cephalisation, the evolution of a head containing sense organs and a brain to process the sensory information.\n\nVertebrates have a tubular gut that extends from the mouth to the anus. The vertebral column typically continues beyond the anus to form an elongated tail. This means that (unlike in some invertebrates like annelid worms) the anus is not usually at the end of the body.\n\nThe ancestral vertebrates, and most extant species, are aquatic and carry out gas exchange in their gills. The gills are finely-branched structures which bring the blood close to the water. They are positioned just behind the head, supported by cartilaginous or bony branchial arches. In jawed vertebrates, the first gill arch pair evolved into the jaws. In amphibians and some primitive bony fishes, the larvae have external gills, branching off from the gill arches. Oxygen is carried from the gills to the body in the blood, and carbon dioxide is returned to the gills, in a closed circulatory system driven by a chambered heart. The tetrapods have lost the gills of their fish ancestors; they have adapted the swim bladder (that fish use for buoyancy) into lungs to breathe air, and the circulatory system is adapted accordingly. At the same time, they adapted the bony fins of the lobe-finned fishes into two pairs of walking legs, carrying the weight of the body via the shoulder and pelvic girdles.\n\nVertebrates vary in size from the smallest frog species such as Brachycephalus pulex, with a minimum adult snout–vent length of 6.45 millimetres (0.254\xa0in) to the blue whale, at up to 33\xa0m (108\xa0ft) and weighing some 150 tonnes.\n\nMolecular markers known as conserved signature indels in protein sequences have been identified and provide distinguishing criteria for the vertebrate subphylum. Five molecular markers are exclusively shared by all vertebrates and reliably distinguish them from all other animals; these include protein synthesis elongation factor-2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, adenosine kinase and a protein related to ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase). A specific relationship between vertebrates and tunicates is supported by two molecular markers, the proteins Rrp44 (associated with the exosome complex) and serine C-palmitoyltransferase. These are exclusively shared by species from these two subphyla, but not by cephalochordates.\n\nVertebrates originated during the Cambrian explosion at the start of the Paleozoic, which saw a rise in animal diversity. The earliest known vertebrates belong to the Chengjiang biota and lived about 518 million years ago. These include Haikouichthys, Myllokunmingia, Zhongjianichthys, and probably Yunnanozoon. Unlike other Cambrian animals, these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan: a notochord, rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail, but lacked jaws. A vertebrate group of uncertain phylogeny, small eel-like conodonts, are known from microfossils of their paired tooth segments from the late Cambrian to the end of the Triassic. Zoologists have debated whether teeth mineralized first, given the hard teeth of the soft-bodied conodonts, and then bones, or vice versa, but it seems that the mineralized skeleton came first.\n\nThe first jawed vertebrates may have appeared in the late Ordovician (~445 mya) and became common in the Devonian period, often known as the "Age of Fishes". The two groups of bony fishes, Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, evolved and became common. By the middle of the Devonian, a lineage of sarcopterygii with both gills and air-breathing lungs adapted to life in swampy pools used their muscular paired fins to propel themselves on land. The fins, already possessing bones and joints, evolved into two pairs of walking legs. These established themselves as amphibians, terrestrial tetrapods, in the next geological period, the Carboniferous. A group of vertebrates, the amniotes, with membranes around the embryo allowing it to survive on dry land, branched from amphibious tetrapods in the Carboniferous.\n\nAt the onset of the Mesozoic, all larger vertebrate groups were devastated after the largest mass extinction in earth history. The following recovery phase saw the emergence of many new vertebrate groups that are still around today, and this time has been described as the origin of modern ecosystems. On the continents, the ancestors of modern lissamphibians, turtles, crocodilians, lizards, and mammals appeared, as well as dinosaurs, which gave rise to birds later in the Mesozoic. In the seas, various groups of marine reptiles evolved, as did new groups of fish. At the end of the Mesozoic, another extinction event extirpated dinosaurs (other than birds) and many other vertebrate groups.\n\nThe Cenozoic, the current era, is sometimes called the "Age of Mammals", because of the dominance of the terrestrial environment by that group. Placental mammals have occupied the Northern Hemisphere, with marsupial mammals in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIn 1811, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck defined the vertebrates as a taxonomic group, a phylum distinct from the invertebrates he was studying. He described them as consisting of four classes, namely fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, but treated the cephalochordates and tunicates as molluscs. In 1866, Ernst Haeckel called both his "Craniata" (vertebrates) and his "Acrania" (cephalochordates) "Vertebrata". In 1877, Ray Lankester grouped the Craniates, cephalochordates, and "Urochordates (tunicates) as "Vertebrata". In 1880–1881, Francis Maitland Balfour placed the Vertebrata as a subphylum within the Chordates. In 2018, Naoki Irie and colleagues proposed making Vertebrata a full phylum.\n\nConventional evolutionary taxonomy groups extant vertebrates into seven classes based on traditional interpretations of gross anatomical and physiological traits. The commonly held classification lists three classes of fish and four of tetrapods. This ignores some of the natural relationships between the groupings. For example, the birds derive from a group of reptiles, so "Reptilia" excluding "Aves" is not a natural grouping; it is described as paraphyletic.\n\nIn addition to these, there are two classes of extinct armoured fishes, Placodermi and Acanthodii, both paraphyletic.\n\nOther ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the phylogeny of early amphibians and reptiles. An example based on work by M.J. Benton in 2004 is given here († = extinct):\n\nWhile this traditional taxonomy is orderly, most of the groups are paraphyletic, meaning that the structure does not accurately reflect the natural evolved grouping. For instance, descendants of the first reptiles include modern reptiles, mammals and birds; the agnathans have given rise to the jawed vertebrates; the bony fishes have given rise to the land vertebrates; a group of amphibians, the labyrinthodonts, have given rise to the reptiles (traditionally including the mammal-like synapsids), which in turn have given rise to the mammals and birds. Most scientists working with vertebrates use a classification based purely on phylogeny, organized by their known evolutionary history.\n\nIt was once thought that the Cephalochordata was the sister taxon to Vertebrata. This group, Notochordata, was taken to be sister to the Tunicata (the Notochordata hypothesis). Since 2006, analysis has shown that the tunicates + vertebrates form a clade, the Olfactores, with Cephalochordata as its sister (the Olfactores hypothesis), as shown in the following phylogenetic tree.\n\nAmphioxiformes (lancelets)\n\nTunicata (sea squirts, etc)\n\nVertebrata\n\nThe internal phylogeny of the vertebrates is shown in the tree.\n\nAgnatha\n\n\n\n\n\nCoelacanths\n\nLungfishes\n\nAmphibians\n\nMammals\n\nSnakes, lizards, geckos\n\nTurtles\n\nCrocodiles\n\nDinosaurs, birds\n\nThe placement of hagfishes on the vertebrate tree of life has been controversial. Their lack of proper vertebrae (among other characteristics of jawless lampreys and jawed vertebrates) led phylogenetic analyses based on morphology to place them outside Vertebrata. Molecular data, however, indicates they are vertebrates closely related to lampreys. An older view is that they are a sister group of vertebrates in the common taxon of Craniata. In 2019, Tetsuto Miyashita and colleagues reconciled the two types of analysis, supporting the Cyclostomata hypothesis using only morphological data.\n\n†Myllokunmingiida\n\n†Anaspida\n\n†Pipiscius\n\n†Euconodonta\n\nCyclostomata (lampreys and hagfishes)\n\nJawed vertebrates\n\nDescribed and extant vertebrate species are split roughly evenly but non-phylogenetically between non-tetrapod "fish" and tetrapods. The following table lists the number of described extant species for each vertebrate class as estimated in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 2014.3. Paraphyletic groups are shown in quotation marks.\n\nThe IUCN estimates that 1,305,075 extant invertebrate species have been described, which means that less than 5% of the described animal species in the world are vertebrates.\n\nThe Living Planet Index, following 16,704 populations of 4,005 species of vertebrates, shows a decline of 60% between 1970 and 2014. Since 1970, freshwater species declined 83%, and tropical populations in South and Central America declined 89%. The authors note that "An average trend in population change is not an average of total numbers of animals lost." According to WWF, this could lead to a sixth major extinction event. The five main causes of biodiversity loss are land-use change, overexploitation of natural resources, climate change, pollution and invasive species.', 'score': 828.0039}, {'id': 'Tunga_penetrans', 'name': ['Tunga penetrans'], 'introduction': '\n\nTunga penetrans is a species of flea also known as the jigger, jigger flea, chigoe, chigo, chigoe flea, chigo flea, nigua, sand flea, or burrowing flea. It is a parasitic insect found in most tropical and sub-tropical climates. In its parasitic phase it has significant impact on its hosts, which include humans and certain other mammalian species. A parasitical infestation of T. penetrans is called tungiasis. Jiggers are often confused with chiggers, a type of mite. Jiggers are native to Central and South America, and have been introduced to sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSynonyms for Tunga penetrans include Sarcopsylla penetrans, Pulex penetrates, and many others.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': "T. penetrans is most recognizable in its parasite phase. While embedded under the stratum corneum layer of the skin, it may reach up to 1\xa0cm across. During the first day or two of infestation, the host may feel an itching or irritation which then passes as the area around the flea calluses and becomes insensitive. As the flea's abdomen swells with eggs later in the cycle, the pressure from the swelling may press neighbouring nerves or blood vessels. Depending on the exact site, this can cause sensations ranging from mild irritation to serious discomfort.\n\nThe colloquial name jigger may be confused with chigger, a parasitical mite. However, the jigger is a type of flea (Order Siphonaptera). The chigger is a minute arachnid. Mites penetrate the skin and feed on skin cells that are broken down through an enzyme they secrete from their mouth, but they will then leave the host. The adult and the larval forms both feed on other animals. This is not the case with T. penetrans, as only the adults feed on mammals, and the mature female remains in the host for the rest of her life.\n\nTunga penetrans is unusual for the 13 known species of the genus Tunga. First, it has a wide distribution: some 88 countries, in the Caribbean, Central and South America, tropical (sub-Saharan) Africa, and India.\nSecond, it can infest a wide variety of hosts: at least 26 different species in over five different orders of mammals.\n\nIn contrast, most of the 13 species of Tungidae are only in the Western hemisphere, and each only targets one or two specific warm-blooded hosts.\n\nSeven tunga species infest only rodents. Two dedicate themselves to armadillos, one to sloths, and another prefers only cattle.  Only one, Tunga trimamillata, has also been found infesting humans as well as cows, but only in Ecuador and Peru.\n\nHost species for  T. penetrans'\n\nFor the most part, the chigoe flea lives 2–5\xa0cm below sand, an observation which helps explain its overall distribution. The temperature is generally too hot for the larvae to develop on the surface of the sand and the deeper sand does not have enough oxygen.\n\nIn a study of off-host stages, samples were taken from the top of the soil (to a maximum depth of 1\xa0cm). The presence of T. penetrans in a soil sample was unaffected by soil temperature, air temperature or air humidity. No life stages of T. penetrans were found in any outdoor sample.\n\nThere is an observable drop in infestations during the wet season.\n\nT. penetrans eggs, on average, are 0.6 mm long, The larva will hatch from the egg within one to six days, assuming the environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, humidity, etc.) are favorable.\n\nAfter hatching, the flea will progress through two instar phases. This is unique in that most fleas go through three. Over the course of that development, the flea will first decrease in size from its just-hatched size of 1.5 mm to 1.15 mm (first instar) before growing to 2.9 mm (second instar).\n\nAbout six to eight days after hatching, the larva pupates and builds a cocoon around itself. Because it lives mostly on and below the surface of sand, sand is used to stabilize the cocoon and help to promote its development. An environmental disturbance such as rain or a lack of sand have been shown to decrease incidence, most likely due to decreasing the environmental factors (i.e., sand) on which the flea depends for overall growth. Barring any disturbances to the cocoon, an adult flea will emerge from the puparium after 9–15 days.\n\nMales are still mobile after a blood meal like other fleas, but the female flea burrows head-first into the host's skin, leaving the caudal tip of its abdomen visible through an orifice in a skin lesion. This orifice allows the flea to breathe, defecate, mate and expel eggs while feeding from blood vessels. It lives in the cutaneous and subcutaneous dermal layer.\n\nTungiasis lesions almost always occur on the feet (97%), but may occur on any part of the body. The toes are afflicted over 70% of the time, with periungual folds (around the toenail) a preferred site.\n\nOnly once the female burrows into the skin can reproduction occur, as the male and female show no interest in each other in the wild. The male flea dies after copulation. The female flea continues in vivo development, described in stages by the Fortaleza classification of tungiasis.\n\nOver the next two weeks, its abdomen swells with up to several hundred to a thousand eggs, which it releases through the caudal orifice to fall to the ground when ready to hatch. The flea then dies and is often the cause of infection as the body rots under the thick scales its body chemistry created to protect it. The eggs mature into adult fleas within three to four weeks and the process begins anew.\n\nIn a seminal paper on the biology and pathology of Tunga penetrans, Eisele et al. (2003) provided and detailed the five stages of tungiasis, thereby detailing the in vivo development of the female chigoe flea for the first time. In dividing the natural history of the disease, the Fortaleza Classification formally describes the last part of the female flea's life cycle where it burrows into its host's skin, expels eggs, and dies.\n\nStage 1 is characterized by the penetration of the skin by the female chigoe flea. Running along the body, the female uses its posterior legs to push its body upward by an angle between 45 and 90 degrees. Penetration then starts, beginning with the proboscis going through the epidermis.\n\nBy stage 2 (days 1–2), penetration is complete and the flea has burrowed most of its body into the skin. Only the anus, the copulatory organs, and four rear air holes in fleas called stigmata remain on the outside of the epidermis. The anus will excrete feces that is thought to attract male fleas for mating, described in a later section. The hypertrophic zone between tergites 2 and 3 in the abdominal region begins to expand a day or two after penetration and takes the appearance of a life belt. During this time, the flea begins to feed on the host's blood.\n\nStage 3 is divided into two substages, the first of which being 2–3 days after penetration is complete. In 3a, maximum hypertrophy is achieved and the flea's midsection swells to the size of a pea.\n\nDue to the expanding flea, the outer layer of the skin is stretched thin, resulting in the appearance of a white halo around the black dot (rear end of the flea) at the center of the lesion. The black dot is the flea's exposed hind legs, respiratory spiracles and reproductive organs.\n\nIn 3b, the chitin exoskeleton of tergites 2 and 3 increase in thickness and gives the structure the look of a mini caldera. Egg release is common in substage 3b, as are fecal coils. The eggs tend to stick to the skin.\nAt about the 3rd week after penetration, stage 4 begins, which is also divided into two substages. In 4a, the flea loses its signs of vitality and appears near death. As a result, the lesion shrinks in size, turns brown, and appears wrinkled. The death of the flea marks the beginning of substage 4b (around day 25 post-penetration) as the body begins to eliminate the parasite through skin repair mechanisms (e.g. shedding and subsequent skin repair). At this phase, the lesion is seen as brown or black.\n\nIf the flea is left within the skin, dangerous complications can occur including secondary infections from trapped bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, enterobacteriaceae, and Clostridium tetani. Lingering effects may include loss of toenails and toe deformation. These seem to be commonplace especially where heavy infestations combine with unsanitary conditions and poverty.\n\nTungiasis was endemic in pre-Columbian Andean society for centuries before discovery of  T. penetrans as native to the West Indies. The first European description was published in 1526 by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, where he discussed the skin infestation and its symptoms on crew members from Columbus's Santa Maria after they were shipwrecked on Haiti. Through ship routes and further expeditions, the chigoe flea was spread to the rest of the world, particularly to the rest of Latin America and Africa. The spread to greater Africa occurred throughout the 17th and 19th centuries, specifically in 1873 when the infected crewmen of the Thomas Mitchell's ship introduced it into Angola, having sailed from Brazil.\n\n\nThere are no drugs currently available with proven effectiveness. Surgical extraction still remains the treatment of choice in patients with a low parasite load, such as tourists returning from endemic areas. The only approach to reduce tungiasis-associated morbidity in heavily affected individuals is the application of a repellent to prevent the penetration of sand fleas.", 'score': 820.76794}, {'id': 'Chlamydia_trachomatis', 'name': ['Chlamydia trachomatis'], 'introduction': '\n\nChlamydia trachomatis (/kləˈmɪdiə trəˈkoʊmətɪs/) is a Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium responsible for chlamydia and trachoma. C. trachomatis exists in two forms, an extracellular infectious elementary body (EB) and an intracellular non-infectious reticulate body (RB). The EB attaches to host cells and enter the cell using effector proteins, where it transforms into the metabolically active RB. Inside the cell, RBs rapidly replicate before transitioning back to EBs, which are then released to infect new host cells.\n\nThe earliest description of C. trachomatis was in 1907 by Stanislaus von Prowazek and Ludwig Halberstädter as a protozoan. It was later thought to be a virus due to its small size and inability to grow in laboratories. It was not until 1966 when it was discovered as a bacterium by electron microscopy where its internal structures were observed.\n\nThere are currently 18 serovars of C. trachomatis, each associated with specific diseases affecting mucosal cells in the lungs, genital tracts, and ocular systems. Infections are often asymptomatic, but can lead to severe complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease in women and epididymitis in men. The bacterium also causes urethritis, conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum in both sexes. C. trachomatis genitourinary infections are diagnosed more frequently in women than in men, with the highest prevalence occurring in females aged 15 to 19 years of age. Infants born from mothers with active chlamydia infections have a pulmonary infection rate that is less than 10%. Globally, approximately 84 million people are affected by C. trachomatis eye infections, with 8 million cases resulting in blindness. C. trachomatis is the leading infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted bacterium.\n\nThe impact of C. trachomatis on human health has been driving vaccine research since its discovery. Currently, no vaccines are available, largely due to the complexity of the immunological pathways involved in C. trachomatis, which remain poorly understood. However, C. trachomatis infections may be treated with several antibiotics, with tetracycline being the preferred option.', 'sections': 'Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative bacterium that can replicate exclusively within a host cell, making it an obligate intracellular pathogen. Over the course of its life cycle, C. trachomatis takes on two distinct forms to facilitate infection and replication. Elementary bodies (EBs) are 200 to 400 nanometers across and are surrounded by a rigid cell wall that enables them to survive in an extracellular form. When an EB encounters a susceptible host cell, it binds to the cell surface and is internalized. The second form, reticulate bodies (RBs) are 600 to 1500 nanometers across, and are found only within host cells. RBs have increased metabolic activity and are adapted for replication. Neither form is motile.\n\nThe evolution of C. trachomatis includes a reduced genome of approximately 1.04 megabases, encoding approximately 900 genes.  In addition to the chromosome that contains most of the genome, nearly all C. trachomatis strains carry a 7.5 kilobase plasmid that contains 8 genes. The role of this plasmid is unknown, although strains without the plasmid have been isolated, suggesting it is not essential for bacterial survival. Several important metabolic functions are not encoded in the C. trachomatis genome and are instead scavenged from the host cell.\n\nC. trachomatis has a reduced metabolic capacity due to its smaller genome, which lacks genes for many biosynthetic pathways including those required for complete carbohydrate metabolism. The bacterium is largely dependent on the host cell for metabolic intermediates and energy, particularly in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). C. trachomatis lacks several enzymes necessary for independent glucose metabolism, and instead utilizes two ATP/ADP translocases (Npt1 and Npt2) to import ATP from the host cell. Other metabolites including amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids are also transported from the host.\n\nA critical enzyme involved in glycolysis, hexokinase, is absent in C. trachomatis, preventing the production of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Instead, G6P from the host cell is taken up by the metabolically active reticulate bodies (RBs) through a G6P transporter (UhpC antiporter). Although C. trachomatis lacks a complete independent glycolysis pathway, it has genes encoding for all the enzymes required for the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), gluconeogenesis, and glycogen synthesis and degradation.\n\nA suppressor of glycolysis, p53, is expressed less frequently in c. trachomatis cells, increasing the rate at which glycolysis occurs, even in the presence of oxygen. As a result, C. trachomatis infection is associated with increased production of pyruvate, lactate, and glutamate by the bacterium due to activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 enzyme limiting conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A. The pyruvate is instead turned into lactate, which allows the cell to grow almost unobstructed by immune response due to the acidic properties of lactate. Excess glycolytic products are, in turn, brought into the PPP to create nucleotides and for biosynthesis. This type of growth is very similar to the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells.\n\nLike other Chlamydia species, C.\xa0trachomatis has a life cycle consisting of two morphologically distinct forms. First, C.\xa0trachomatis attaches to a new host cell as a small spore-like form called the elementary body. The elementary body enters the host cell, surrounded by a host vacuole, called an inclusion. Within the inclusion, C.\xa0trachomatis transforms into a larger, more metabolically active form called the reticulate body. The reticulate body substantially modifies the inclusion, making it a more hospitable environment for rapid replication of the bacteria, which occurs over the following 30 to 72 hours. The massive number of intracellular bacteria then transition back to resistant elementary bodies before causing the cell to rupture and being released into the environment. These new elementary bodies are then shed in the semen or released from epithelial cells of the female genital tract and attach to new host cells.\n\nC. trachomatis are bacteria in the genus Chlamydia, a group of obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells. Chlamydial cells cannot carry out energy metabolism and they lack biosynthetic pathways.\n\nC. trachomatis strains are generally divided into three biovars based on the type of disease they cause. These are further subdivided into several serovars based on the surface antigens recognized by the immune system. Serovars A through C cause trachoma, which is the world\'s leading cause of preventable infectious blindness. Serovars D through K infect the genital tract, causing pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and infertility. Serovars L1 through L3 cause an invasive infection of the lymph nodes near the genitals, called lymphogranuloma venereum.\n\nC. trachomatis is thought to have diverged from other Chlamydia species around 6 million years ago. This genus contains a total of nine species: C.\xa0trachomatis, C.\xa0muridarum, C.\xa0pneumoniae, C.\xa0pecorum, C.\xa0suis, C.\xa0abortus, C.\xa0felis, C.\xa0caviae, and C.\xa0psittaci. The closest relative to C.\xa0trachomatis is C.\xa0muridarum, which infects mice. C.\xa0trachomatis along with C. pneumoniae have been found to infect humans to a greater extent. C.\xa0trachomatis exclusively infects humans. C.\xa0pneumoniae is found to also infect horses, marsupials, and frogs. Some of the other species can have a considerable impact on human health due to their known zoonotic transmission.\n\nStrains that cause lymphogranuloma venereum (Serovars L1 to L3)\n\nMost prevalent genital strains (Serovars D-F)\n\nLess prevalent genital strains (Serovars G-K, and some strains of Serovar D)\n\nOcular strains (Serovars A-C)\n\nClinical signs and symptoms of C.\xa0trachomatis infection in the genitalia present as the chlamydia infection, which may be asymptomatic or may resemble a gonorrhea infection.\nBoth are common causes of multiple other conditions including pelvic inflammatory disease and urethritis.\n\nC. trachomatis is the single most important infectious agent associated with blindness (trachoma), and it also affects the eyes in the form of inclusion conjunctivitis and is responsible for about 19% of adult cases of conjunctivitis.\n\nC. trachomatis in the lungs presents as the chlamydia pneumoniae respiratory infection and can affect all ages.\n\nElementary bodies are generally present in the semen of infected men and vaginal secretions of infected women. When they come into contact with a new host cell, the elementary bodies bind to the cell via interaction between adhesins on their surface and several host receptor proteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Once attached, the bacteria inject various effector proteins into the host cell using a type three secretion system. These effectors trigger the host cell to take up the elementary bodies and prevent the cell from triggering apoptosis. Within 6 to 8 hours after infection, the elementary bodies transition to reticulate bodies and a number of new effectors are synthesized. These effectors include a number of proteins that modify the inclusion membrane (Inc proteins), as well as proteins that redirect host vesicles to the inclusion. 8 to 16 hours after infection, another set of effectors are synthesized, driving acquisition of nutrients from the host cell. At this stage, the reticulate bodies begin to divide, coinciding with the expansion of the inclusion. If several elementary bodies have infected a single cell, their inclusions will fuse at this point to create a single large inclusion in the host cell. From 24 to 72 hours after infection, reticulate bodies transition to elementary bodies which are released either by lysis of the host cell or extrusion of the entire inclusion into the host genital tract.\n\nThe chlamydial plasmid, a DNA molecule existing separately from the genome of C. trachomatis, functions to enhance genetic diversity via the genes encoded.The plasmid gene protein 3 (pgp3) has been linked to the establishment of persistent infection within the genital tract by suppressing the host immune response.\n\nPolymorphic outer membrane proteins (Pmp proteins) on the surface of C. trachomatis use tropism to bind specific host cell receptors, which in turn initiates infection. Pmp proteins B, D, and H have been most associated with eliciting a pro-inflammatory response through the release of cytokines.\n\nCPAF (Chlamydia Protease-like Activity Factor) functions by preventing the host from triggering the proper immune response. C. trachomatis use of CPAF targets and cleaves proteins that restructure the Golgi apparatus and activate DNA repair so that C. trachomatis is able to use the host cell machinery and proteins to its advantage.\n\nMost people infected with C.\xa0trachomatis are asymptomatic. However, the bacteria can present in one of three ways: genitourinary (genitals), pulmonary (lungs), and ocular (eyes).\n\nGenitourinary cases can include genital discharge, vaginal bleeding, itchiness (pruritus), painful urination (dysuria), among other symptoms. Often, symptoms are similar to those of a urinary tract infection.[citation needed]\n\nWhen C.\xa0trachomatis presents in the eye in the form of trachoma, it begins by gradually thickening the eyelids and eventually begins to pull the eyelashes into the eyelid. In the form of inclusion conjunctivitis, the infection presents with redness, swelling, mucopurulent discharge from the eye, and most other symptoms associated with adult conjunctivitis.\n\nC. trachomatis may latently infect the chorionic villi tissues of pregnant women, thereby impacting pregnancy outcome.\n\nThree times as many women are diagnosed with genitourinary C.\xa0trachomatis infections as men. Women aged 15–19 have the highest prevalence, followed by women aged 20–24, although the rate of increase of diagnosis is greater for men than for women. Risk factors for genitourinary infections include unprotected sex with multiple partners, lack of condom use, and low socioeconomic status living in urban areas.\n\nPulmonary infections can occur in infants born to women with active chlamydia infections, although the rate of infection is less than 10%.\n\nOcular infections take the form of inclusion conjunctivitis or trachoma, both in adults and children. About 84 million worldwide develop C.\xa0trachomatis eye infections and 8 million are blinded as a result of the infection. Trachoma is the primary source of infectious blindness in some parts of rural Africa and Asia and is a neglected tropical disease that has been targeted by the World Health Organization for elimination by 2020. Inclusion conjunctivitis from C.\xa0trachomatis is responsible for about 19% of adult cases of conjunctivitis.\n\nTreatment depends on the infection site, age of the patient, and whether another infection is present. Having a C.\xa0trachomatis and one or more other sexually transmitted infections at the same time is possible. Treatment is often done with both partners simultaneously to prevent reinfection. C.\xa0trachomatis may be treated with several antibiotic medications, including azithromycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, and tetracycline.\n\nTetracycline is the most preferred antibiotic to treat C.trachomatis and has the highest success rate. Azithromycin and doxycycline have equal efficacy to treat C.\xa0trachomatis with 97 and 98 percent success, respectively. Azithromycin is dosed as a 1 gram tablet that is taken by mouth as a single dose, primarily to help with concerns of non-adherence. Treatment with generic doxycycline 100\xa0 mg twice a day for 7 days has equal success with expensive delayed-release doxycycline 200\xa0mg once a day for 7 days. Erythromycin is less preferred as it may cause gastrointestinal side effects, which can lead to non-adherence. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin are generally no better than azithromycin or doxycycline and are more expensive.\n\nIf treatment is necessary during pregnancy, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, and doxycycline are not prescribed. In the case of a patient who is pregnant, the medications typically prescribed are azithromycin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin. Azithromycin is the recommended medication and is taken as a 1 gram tablet taken by mouth as a single dose. Despite amoxicillin having fewer side effects than the other medications for treating antenatal C.\xa0trachomatis infection, there have been concerns that pregnant women who take penicillin-class antibiotics can develop a chronic persistent chlamydia infection. Tetracycline is not used because some children and even adults can not withstand the drug, causing harm to the mother and fetus. Retesting during pregnancy can be performed three weeks after treatment. If the risk of reinfection is high, screening can be repeated throughout pregnancy.\n\nIf the infection has progressed, ascending the reproductive tract and pelvic inflammatory disease develops, damage to the fallopian tubes may have already occurred. In most cases, the C.\xa0trachomatis infection is then treated on an outpatient basis with azithromycin or doxycycline. Treating the mother of an infant with C.\xa0trachomatis of the eye, which can evolve into pneumonia, is recommended. The recommended treatment consists of oral erythromycin base or ethylsuccinate 50\xa0mg/kg/day divided into four doses daily for two weeks while monitoring for symptoms of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in infants less than 6 weeks old.\n\nThere have been a few reported cases of C.trachomatis strains that were resistant to multiple antibiotic treatments. However, as of 2018, this is not a major cause of concern as antibiotic resistance is rare in C.trachomatis compared to other infectious bacteria.\n\nChlamydia species are readily identified and distinguished from other Chlamydia species using DNA-based tests. Tests for Chlamydia can be ordered from a doctor, a lab or online.\n\nMost strains of C.\xa0trachomatis are recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to epitopes in the VS4 region of MOMP. However, these mAbs may also cross-react with two other Chlamydia species, C.\xa0suis and C.\xa0muridarum.[citation needed]\n\nStudies have revealed antibiotic resistance in Chlamydia trachomatis. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, including A2057G and A2059G, have been identified as significant contributors to resistance against azithromycin, a commonly used treatment. This resistance is linked to treatment failures and persistent infections, necessitating ongoing research into alternative antibiotics, such as moxifloxacin, as well as non-antibiotic approaches like bacteriophage therapy. These innovations aim to combat resistance while reducing the overall burden of antibiotic misuse, which has been closely associated with the rise of resistant strains in C. trachomatis populations.\n\nAdditionally, diagnostic improvements have played a vital role in identifying C. trachomatis infections more efficiently. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as DNA- and RNA-based tests, have shown high sensitivity and specificity, making them the gold standard for detecting asymptomatic infections. NAATs have facilitated broader screening programs, particularly in high-risk populations, and are integral to public health initiatives aimed at controlling the spread of C. trachomatis. Research continues into point-of-care diagnostic tools, which promise faster results and greater accessibility, especially in low-resource settings.\n\nIn the area of vaccine development, creating an effective vaccine for C. trachomatis has proven challenging due to the complex immune responses the bacterium elicits. Subunit vaccines, which target outer membrane proteins like MOMP (Major Outer Membrane Protein) and polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmp), are being explored in both animal models and early human trials. While these vaccines show promise in inducing partial immunity in murine models, further research is needed to evaluate their efficacy in humans. The goal is to develop a vaccine that can prevent reinfection without causing harmful inflammatory responses.\n\nC. trachomatis was first described in 1907 by Stanislaus von Prowazek and Ludwig Halberstädter in scrapings from trachoma cases. Thinking they had discovered a "mantled protozoan", they named the organism "Chlamydozoa" from the Greek "Chlamys" meaning mantle. Over the next several decades, "Chlamydozoa" was thought to be a virus as it was small enough to pass through bacterial filters and unable to grow on known laboratory media. However, in 1966, electron microscopy studies showed C.\xa0trachomatis to be a bacterium. This is essentially due to the fact that they were found to possess DNA, RNA, and ribosomes like other bacteria. It was originally believed that Chlamydia lacked peptidoglycan because researchers were unable to detect muramic acid in cell extracts. Subsequent studies determined that C. trachomatis synthesizes both muramic acid and peptidoglycan, but relegates it to the microbe\'s division septum and does not utilize it for construction of a cell wall. The bacterium is still classified as gram-negative.\n\nC. trachomatis agent was first cultured and isolated in the yolk sacs of eggs by Tang Fei-fan et al. in 1957. This was a significant milestone because it became possible to preserve these agents, which could then be used for future genomic and phylogenetic studies. The isolation of C.\xa0trachomatis coined the term isolate to describe how C.\xa0trachomatis has been isolated from an in vivo setting into a "strain" in cell culture. Only a few "isolates" have been studied in detail, limiting the information that can be found on the evolutionary history of C.\xa0trachomatis.\n\nIn the 1990s it was shown that there are several species of Chlamydia. Chlamydia trachomatis was first described in historical records in Ebers papyrus written between 1553 and 1550 BC. In the ancient world, it was known as the blinding disease trachoma. The disease may have been closely linked with humans and likely predated civilization. It is now known that C.\xa0trachomatis comprises 19 serovars which are identified by monoclonal antibodies that react to epitopes on the major outer-membrane protein (MOMP). Comparison of amino acid sequences reveals that MOMP contains four variable segments: S1,2 ,3 and 4. Different variants of the gene that encodes for MOMP, differentiate the genotypes of the different serovars. The antigenic relatedness of the serovars reflects the homology levels of DNA between MOMP genes, especially within these segments.\n\nFurthermore, there have been over 220 Chlamydia vaccine trials done on mice and other non-human host species to target C.\xa0muridarum and C.\xa0trachomatis strains. However, it has been difficult to translate these results to the human species due to physiological and anatomical differences. Future trials are working with closely related species to humans.', 'score': 820.1124}, {'id': 'Notropis_volucellus', 'name': ['Notropis volucellus'], 'introduction': '\n\nThe mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) is a species of North American cyprinid freshwater fish in the genus Notropis. The genus Notropis is commonly known as the eastern shiners. It is native to areas of the Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, much of the Mississippi River basin including areas of Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and regions of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas. However, this particular species can be found in other places such as the Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut and Housatonic rivers. This genus is usually characterized by almost all having a complete lateral line, 8 dorsal fin rays, a premaxillae protactile, and a silvery or speckled peritoneum. As the common name indicates, this species is difficult to classify in the wild because it looks similar to many other shiners. In fact, some even hypothesize that this species is actually a complexity of many cryptic species.  While this is the case, it is important to take more caution to not misidentify this species and to understand its impact on introduced areas.\n\nThe diet of N. volucellus consists of some terrestrial insects, small crustaceans, and midge pupae and larvae.  Mimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years, and are suspected to reach sexual maturity after one year. In lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants.  When found in small streams N. volucellus are generally in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes.  The diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer.\n\nThis fish is suspected to have been introduced to many areas via bait bucket release.  Because negative impacts of the introduction of this species have not been documented and because this species is not listed as threatened, there is not much immediate need for conservation efforts of this species.', 'kingdom': 'Animalia', 'sections': 'Historically, this species has been mostly found in the southern Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, and much of Mississippi River basin except in the northern Great Plains region and is oddly missing from many of its tributaries. The mimic shiner is also in Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, and Housatonic rivers along with the region of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas.\n\nHowever, currently this species can also be found in Susquehanna River, drainage in New York, Potomac River, East Branch of the Delaware River collected in 2002, Connecticut River drainage of Massachusetts, low altitude, Connecticut regions such as Westhill Pond, upper Nashua drainage of Massachusetts, Housatonic River drainage in Massachusetts.\n\nIt is suspected that the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas may be due to a change in hydraulic regimes due to fragmentation of landscapes along with urbanization and development. Due to fragmentation of the landscape near or around riverine ecosystems, there is less available vegetation along these areas. With less vegetation, a faster flow of water pours into streams and rivers and possibly causes erosion to its banks. This influx of water and higher velocity of flow could have negative impacts on this species that lives in areas that has a relatively slow to moderate current.\n\nNotropis volucellus can generally be found in sandy pools of headwaters, creeks, clear small to large rivers, and in quiet areas of lakes while avoiding small, headwater streams, and swampy and marshy areas. In small streams N. volucellus are in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes.  When monitoring one most often will find mimic shiners near riffles in current and often will find them schooling in mid-water or at the surface of water.\n\nBecause this is a small fish, mimic shiners have many piscivorous predators that are bigger in size. Such predators include northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, rock bass, and brown bullhead among others.\n\nThe diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer. One study showed that Daphnia was present in 85% of all stomachs sampled and zooplankton  (copepods and Chydorus) was found in greater than 30% of stomach samples in August. Fish aged at 0 ate mostly Chydorus, but in the summer were found to eat varying amounts of invertebrates like small leeches and some chironomids. At age 2, mimic shiners were found to eat other invertebrates than those stated after May while their diet consisted of 50–80% filamentous algae in September and early October but less than 50% at other times. In this study no other large fish populations, except for some centrarchids, were found that would compete for Daphnia as a food source.\n\nDue to pollution from humans, many fish have been observed to bioaccumulate mercury. While effects of bioaccumulation are mostly studied in the larger piscivores, they can also be observed in smaller prey such as theNotropis volucellus. A rise in mercury levels in water could cause the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas.\n\nMimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years. This species, at least documented in Tennessee, reach sexual maturity after their first year of growth.  Spawning of this species varies depending on different locations due to differences in seasons and temperature changes. In Minnesota and Wisconsin this occurs from May to August while in Alabama this event occurs from mid-April to early August.  However, because males produce nuptial tubercles from late May to early October in Tennessee, it is suggested that Notropis volucellus have a longer breeding season than other areas which peak in the summer.  In lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants.  In streams, however, spawning location has not yet been documented. Clutch sizes increases per female with an increase in body size, ranging from 74 to 386 oocytes produced from body sizes ranging from 36.4 to 45.1\xa0mm (1.43 to 1.78\xa0in).  These fertilized eggs are demersal and adhesive.\n\nBecause spawning varies depending on varying seasons and temperature changes, it is not unimaginable to predict changes in spawning due to global temperature changes in the future. As of yet, there has not been much research regarding Notropis volucellus. As stated before, human-caused development and deforestation around the areas alter current of streams and also alter turbidity. Also stated above, the mimic shiner breeds in areas that are clear, has little current, and contains vegetation. Changes in the hydraulic regime of the habitats mimic shiners live in could create unfavorable conditions to reproduce.\n\nSome places do claim that this species has declined significantly in certain areas. The department of Natural Resources of Ohio state that the mimic shiner was once found all over Ohio, but it is now not as abundant in many places as it used to be. In table 2 of a paper discussing effects of landscape change on fish abundances, the mimic shiner is also listed as intolerant to disturbances and thus has been decreasing in number.\n\nHowever, many other regions believe this fish to be invasive. The mimic shiner is suspected to have been introduced into many regions. The source is believed to be the spread via the sport of fishing. It is reported, though not commonly sold in stores as such, mimic shiners were used in vast quantities as bait in Wisconsin lake and were even used as a primary source for food for fishes at one hatchery.\n\nNot much is being done to protect this specific species nor are many groups focusing on the mimic shiner. This is not unusual seeing how it is not listed as needing protection according to the IUCN red list of threatened species the population of Notropis volucellus is stable and its conservation status is of least concern.\n\nWhile pollution and dams are a major problem or water ecosystems, this fish has not been reported to need assistance in respects to conservation. Instead of needing protection, they need to be prevented from being introduced into non-native areas. It is likely that they could cause disruption to their non-native introduced ranges due to competition for resources.', 'score': 819.39954}, {'id': 'Plasmodiophora_brassicae', 'name': ['Plasmodiophora brassicae'], 'introduction': '\n\nPlasmodiophora brassicae is a soilborne organism that is best known for its high economic impact on Brassica oil and vegetable crops. It infects 30 different cruciferous plants, which consists of up to 16 crop species, 9 ornamentals, and 5 weeds. The fungus on those plants causes a disease referred to as clubroot.', 'sections': 'Plasmodiophora brassicae was once referred to as a slime mold but was then transferred to the Phytomyxea group.\n\nPlasmodiophora brassicae exhibits two main forms within its life cycle. It is either a spore that is ready to infect roots or it becomes a persistent spore in the soil. That, or the fungus can become a somewhat mobile zoospore, which is a spindle shaped biflagellate cell.\n\nPlasmodiophora brassicae life cycle consists of two main phases. Phase one is a sporangial stage which will lead to a short-lived zoospore. Stage two leads to a sporogenic phase which creates persistent resting spores. Within the two phases P. brassicae has three distinct stages within its lifecycle. Starting with survival within the soil, from there it will find a host and infect the root hairs of the plant, and finally it will start the cortical infection.\n\nIt was first discovered in Europe in the 13th century and has since traveled across the globe. It has been reported in over sixty different countries. \xa0including countries such as China, United States, and most other major countries. It survives in the soil around its target host while also being found in particular waterways, which most likely came from runoff of fields and soil that has already been infected with club root.\n\nAs P. brassicae can infect more than just crops such as ornamental flowers and other ornamentals and even some weeds, the focus will be on crops as that has the most detrimental effect to humans and other species. It has been found to infect many crops that we use as a main food source. Crops like cabbage, brussels sprouts, turnips, broccoli, mustard, and radishes.\n\nSymptoms of P. brassicae are the swelling of the roots which cause “clubs”. These clubs can be found on primary roots, secondary roots, tap roots, and even the area of the stalk just under ground level. Larger clubs are formed on larger roots especially just under the surface of the soil.\n\nControlling P. brassicae can be quite difficult. There are two main ways to help control this organism. The first way would be cultural control and the other is chemical control. Within cultural control the objective is to keep the fungi under control so that it does not affect the farmers’ bottom dollar. Do this by removing the fungus’ favorable conditions which are excessive moisture in the soil, temperatures ranging from 18 to 25 degrees Celsius, and low pH in the soil. Good draining soil while also raising the pH of the soil by adding lime powder are good non-chemical ways to control P. brassicae. Within chemicals there are soil sterilants and Fungicides that can be sprayed into the fields of effected soils.', 'score': 818.02344}, {'id': 'Phyllophaga_congrua', 'name': ['Phyllophaga congrua'], 'introduction': '\n\nPhyllophaga congrua is a species of scarab beetle in the family Scarabaeidae.

It reaches 74\xa0cm (29\xa0in) in length. It is native to the Marowijne and Essequibo drainages in the Guianas, and the Branco River in Brazil. It has also been introduced to regions outside its natural range (e.g., Florida, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico), but some uncertainty exists over the exact identity, and at least some of the introductions may involve another Cichla species or hybrids. It is frequently confused with C. monoculus. Studies conclude that the introduction of Cichla ocellaris does not negatively impact fish communities in Florida, making it an effective fisheries management tool.', 'sections': 'Similarly shaped in body size compared to the largemouth bass, the butterfly peacock bass can reach lengths of up to 29\xa0in (740\xa0mm), but averages 12–14\xa0in (300–360\xa0mm) in length. Body and fin colors range from yellows, greens, and light red to orange. While color is extremely variable, the most prominent physical characteristics are the three vertical black lines along the sides of the body. With having the tendency to fade, these lines may not be found on some older fish. The common name of the fish originates from the black spot with a yellow halo surrounding.\xa0 This spot is located on the caudal fin and resembles the feathers of a peacock.\n\nSpawning season for the fish is between April and September, with a height in May and June. Like other bass, adult fish create large flat surfaces that are hardened down near the shore in order to serve as a spawn location. Once the eggs are laid, both adults are responsible for protecting them from prey.\n\nThe growth from spawn to the average length of 12–14 inches progresses rapidly throughout the first 16–18 months of life. Upon additional growth beyond the average, a fish can potentially add up to 1.5 pounds of weight with every extra inch grown. Average lifespan for the Butterfly Peacock Bass is 6–10 years.\n\nNative to the tropical Americas, the true Cichla ocellaris is restricted to the Guianas. The species thrives in warm, slow-moving bodies of water including lakes, ponds, canals, and rock pits. Like other species of bass, they tend to inhabit shaded areas under trees, bridges, and culverts. Butterfly peacock bass cannot survive in salinities exceeding 18 ppt, nor can they live in temperatures less than 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn 1984, the Florida Fish and Game Commission introduced the species to the lakes and rivers of Miami-Dade County, in south Florida. Upon introduction, roughly 10,000 young fish were introduced to the Miami-Dade County area via releasing the juveniles into the lakes and canals. Distribution throughout the area can be attributed to the travel of this species through the warm, freshwater canals of Florida. It is thought that these fish inhabit up to 300 miles (500\xa0km) of canals specifically. Due to the fish\'s inability to tolerate salt water and low water temperatures, this species of fish is typically found only in the Miami-Dade and Broward County areas of Florida, with a few sightings in Texas and Louisiana.\n\nThis species has also been introduced in large numbers to Trị An Lake in Vietnam\n\nThe introduction of the butterfly peacock bass to Florida has successfully aided in managing and controlling tilapia and oscar populations that once were a threat via overpopulation. The fish primarily feeds on fish allowing for them to be roleplayers in the balancing of a habitat. These fish typically feed during daylight hours where visibility is better for hunting. Like other bass, they use their incredible speed and large mouth to capture prey.\n\nRegarded as the most popular sportfish in south Florida, millions of game fishermen travel each year to fish for Butterfly Peacock Bass, spending about 8 million dollars combined in resources and efforts. The fish is available to boat fishermen along with fishermen located on the shore. The species is fished similarly to largemouth bass, with shiners used as live bait and topwater jigs and jerkbaits as suggested tackle. Florida includes a daily bag limit of two fish, with a maximum length of 17\xa0in (430\xa0mm).\n\nThe edibility of the fish is considered to be very good, as it provides a clean and flaky white filet.
